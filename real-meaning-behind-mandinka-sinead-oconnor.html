According to <a href=#>The New Yorker</a>, "Roots" is, above all, an exploration: of identity, history, and, of course, roots. Based on the oral history passed down from his grandmother, Alex Haley's historical fiction novel recounts the harrowing experience of his African ancestor, Kunta Kinte, as a slave in America, filling in the blanks when necessary. The book was adapted for television a year later, became a smash hit, and was watched by none other than Sinéad O'Connor.</p><p dir=ltr>In the book (and subsequent TV adaptation), the Mandinka are the ethnic group that Haley's family comes from. Originating from West Africa, the name also refers to the language group. However, O'Connor's connection with the Mandinka has less to do with the ethnic group's actual history, and more to do with her own personal experiences. Throughout the song's chorus, she claims she "don't know no shame" and "[feels] no pain," but that she does know "Mandinka."</p><p dir=ltr>In her 2021 memoir "Rememberings"&nbsp;(via <a href=#>Ringer</a>), O'Connor recalled the emotions that "Roots" stirred up in her: "I was a young girl when I saw it, and it moved something so deeply in me, I had a visceral response. I came to emotionally identify with the civil rights movement and slavery, especially given the theocracy I lived in and the oppression in my own home." The abuse she suffered at the hands of her mother was one of the many <a href=#>heartbreaking details about Sinéad O'Connor's life</a>. Through "Mandinka," O'Connor releases her pent-up resentment and embarks on a journey toward a newfound identity.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57kGxscmhgaXyzscClZKadkaO2r7OMm5yhoZ6Zeq6tzZ2gp6ORYsCqusSam2ank6S7r7vRaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
