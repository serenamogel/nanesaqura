But out of all of the strange things that have ever befell my eyes or ears, without a doubt, the strangest tend to be whenever a celebrity talks about fame or being famous or the consequences of it. For this very reason, I have decided to compile an extra special list of <a href=# class=T3D>celebrity quotes about fame</a> that show just how strange a phenomenon is it, <i>and</i> so you can scratch your head along with me.</p><p>The thing is, often times it isn’t even the celebrity who is being eccentric. It’s just that the concept of fame is so absolutely strange to begin with that the things they divulge are almost unfathomable. That said, there are also those stars who wax poetic and sort of miss the mark trying to explain themselves to normal people like us. After all, we aren’t them and we haven’t experienced fame as they have. Either way, it makes for an exceptionally interesting read all around — and will probably make you think twice about wanting to be famous yourself.</p><p>Here are 11 super weird quotes about fame from celebrities that you have to read to believe.</p><h3>1. Kanye West</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>If you can figure out this Twitter stream of consciousness on fame, let me know.</p><h3>2. Katy Perry</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Randy Shropshire/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>The singer told <i>Teen Vogue</i> </a>,</p>I'm tired of being famous already! But I'm not tired of creating. Fame is, I think, just a disgusting by-product of what I do.<p>There are a lot of words I'd use to describe fame, but "disgusting" probably would not be one of them. I'm not famous so I can't say she's wrong, per se. It's just that the very nature of being a pop star is fame — "pop" is what's "popular." It's just kinda, well, <i>weird </i>when you think about it.</p><h3>3. Taylor Swift</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Swift said to <i>Esquire</i> </a>.</p>I fought the idea of having security for a very long time, because I really value normalcy. I really do. I like to be able to take a drive by myself. Haven't done that in six years...<p>Talk about strange. All T. Swift wants to do is drive around alone — not conquer the world or become the first pop star in space. She's tickled by the idea of driving to Starbucks without some beefy dude watching her sing along to the radio.</p><h3>4. Kylie Jenner</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Frazer Harrison/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>She told <i>Elle UK</i> </a>,</p>Once I have a kid I'm not going to be on Instagram. You know, I'll probably delete my Instagram and just… I don't know, live life.<p>I suppose when you're famous Instagram is the root of all evil (?!). But this claim is especially odd considering that she has a reality show documenting her life far more intimately than Instagram ever could.</p><h3>5. Britney Spears</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images</p></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>The pop singer explained to the <i>Vegas Player</i> </a>,</p>This is the thing: I'm actually really shy. I don't like having my picture taken. I don't like the attention, but it's something that comes with success. I've accepted the paparazzi are going to be there; I just try to wear the same thing every day so I become uninteresting.<p>This is especially weird, because who the heck would have ever thought Britney Spears, of all the people in the entire world, would be <i>shy</i>? Certainly not me.</p><h3>6. Zayn Malik</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>Malik tried to explain what "mass hysteria" is like when it's directed at you and, my gosh, does it truly seem like the most bizarre thing <i>ever.</i> <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>He told <i>Rolling Stone</i> </a>,</p>It's that thing that we've sometimes talked about — when you hear yourself on the radio or see yourself on the front of a magazine — and you sometimes don't get it; you can't believe it's actually happening to you. Even the girls running down the street still doesn't really hit you. It's like, "No, they can't be running for me; for us." It's really strange, and it's hard to put into words, but it's almost like you know it's happening and you know you should believe it, but you almost don't.7. Miley Cyrus<figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Jemal Countess/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Cyrus told <i>The New York Times</i></a> that due to the "luxury" of fame, "I can just do what I want to do, and make the music I want to make." But that also extends to a far more surreal notion. She proclaimed of her fantastical, trippy antics,</p>I created my surroundings, my own world. What seems like fantasy or trippy, it’s not to me. It’s my actual reality.<h3>8. Justin Bieber</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Christopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Biebs explained to <i>NME</i></a> how his "wholesome pop star" persona made his antics seem more monstrous using this interesting metaphor,</p>If you see Ghandi roll up a blunt, it’s different to seeing Ryan Gosling roll up a blunt. You wouldn’t give Ryan Gosling a hard time.<p><i>Uh</i>... sure, Biebs. Sure.</p>9. Kristen Stewart<figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>John Sciulli/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>According to <i>Harper's Bazaar</i> </a>, fame used to be like an actual sickness to K. Stew. She talked about her infamous awkwardness to the publication, saying,</p>Control issues make me so nervous. It’s not knowing what’s going to happen. So what people were seeing was what happens when you are terrified. My palms sweat, my knees shake, I don’t think I can stand in my heels, I’m breathing heavily, I feel nauseous. I’ll be so nervous and then my body creates something to calm me down and I get so tired.<p>Stranger than fiction — fame can make you ill.</p><h3>10. Chrissy Teigen</h3><p>Apparently, when you're famous, your own family becomes your fans. Which is odd considering they know about that really embarrassing thing you used to do as a kid.</p><h3>11. Harry Styles</h3><figure class="Qf5 E1M" readability=2><p>Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images</p></figure><p>During a press conference, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Styles once talked about why he hates the word "famous."</a></p><p>Yes. It's just a word. But he explained why and it makes a heck of a lot of sense. He explained, "Because I feel like when people label people as 'famous' they take away a lot of substance that they have as a person."</p><p>Well, when you put it that way... <i>true</i>.</p><p>So, how are your dream about being famous feeling now?</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxygY9raGtlYWZ6pLHLnplmqaWkwaa%2FjJqZqK2kYrOiucRmq6GZpGLAqbvWZqGuq6RitbDDjKyrq5menLJursSipaBllpa6sMHSZqCs</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
