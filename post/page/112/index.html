Recommended Videos When the former president teased an upcoming announcement, many people assumed it had to do with his 2024 presidential bid. Instead, Trump surprised his followers with a very different development. The 45th U.S. president is officially selling limited edition trading cards as NFTs. The cards situate Trump in a variety of fictional and actual scenarios from the businessman and politician’s life, leaving his followers to choose between shots of him golfing, racing, and stylized images of him posing as a cowboy or astronaut. <a href=../../../is-donald-trump-raising-money-for-his-campaign-with-trump-card-nfts.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../phoenix-marie.html>Phoenix Marie Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>
