His theorem asserts that (under appropriate assumptions) the total energy of a gravitating system is always positive and can be zero only if the geometry of spacetime is that of flat Minkowski space.</p><p>It establishes Minkowski space as a stable ground state of the gravitational field. While the original proof of this result due to Richard Schoen and Shing-Tung Yau used variational methods, his proof used ideas from supergravity theory to simplify the argument.</p><h2 id=h-edward-witten-other-work><span class=ez-toc-section id=-edward-witten-other-work></span>&nbsp;Edward Witten Other Work<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In general, Witten has done influential and insightful works in many aspects of quantum field theories and mathematical physics, including the physics and mathematics of anomalies, integrability, dualities, localization, homologies and so on.</p><p>Many of his results have deeply influenced many areas in theoretical physics (often well beyond the original context of his results), including string theory, quantum gravity, and topological condensed matter.</p><h2 id=h-edward-witten-hobbies-and-personal-interests><span class=ez-toc-section id=edward-witten-hobbies-and-personal-interests></span>Edward Witten Hobbies and Personal Interests<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Hobbies</strong>: Reading, badminton, Spending time with family, Nature walks</li><li><strong>Passions</strong>: Mathematics</li><li><strong>Interests</strong>: Research, Philanthropy</li><li><strong>Books</strong>: Not specified</li><li><strong>Favorite Movies</strong>: Not specified</li><li><strong>Sports Team</strong>: To be Updated</li></ul><h2 id=h-edward-witten-honors-and-awards><span class=ez-toc-section id=edward-witten-honors-and-awards></span>Edward Witten Honors and Awards<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Edward Witten has been honored with numerous awards including:</p><ul><li>A MacArthur Grant (1982)</li><li>The Fields Medal (1990)</li><li>The Nemmers Prize in Mathematics (2000)</li><li>The National Medal of Science (2002)</li><li>Pythagoras Award (2005)</li><li>The Henri Poincaré Prize (2006)</li><li>The Crafoord Prize (2008</li></ul><h2 id=h-edward-witten-publications><span class=ez-toc-section id=edward-witten-publications></span>Edward Witten Publications<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Some Problems in the Short Distance Analysis of Gauge Theories.&nbsp;Princeton University, 1976.
