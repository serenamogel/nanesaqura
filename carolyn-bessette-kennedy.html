Declared a trendsetter by the national press, Bessette was often compared to her late mother-in-law, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/jacqueline-kennedy-onassis data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</a>, because of her fierce protection of her own (and Kennedy's) privacy, as well as her work for charitable causes. Bessette was killed, along with JFK Jr. and her sister, Lauren, when their small private plane, piloted by Kennedy, crashed off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, on July 16, 1999.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born in White Plains, New York, on January 7, 1966, and voted "ultimate beautiful person" of her high school class of 1983, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy grew up in a wealthy corner of Connecticut, just outside of New York City, with her older sisters, twins Lisa and Lauren. Bessette moved to Connecticut with her mother and sisters at age 8 when her parents divorced. Her mother, a school administrator, remarried a prominent doctor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After graduating from a Catholic high school, Bessette earned an undergraduate degree in education at Boston University. (She was the cover girl for the "Girls of BU" 1988 calendar.) Her first job after college was in public relations for a nightclub company in New England. She went to work at Calvin Klein's store in Boston and then transferred to the company's New York location.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Marriage to JFK Jr.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Six feet tall with long blonde hair, Bessette was linked with an assortment of men before John F. Kennedy Jr., including a Calvin Klein model, a pro hockey player and the heir to the Benetton fashion company fortune. She first met and spoke with Kennedy Jr. when they were both running in Central Park; she impressed him with her beauty, intelligence and sincerity. Their fairy-tale marriage in 1996 took place in a 100-year-old, flower strewn chapel on a secluded island off the Georgian coast.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After her marriage to JFK Jr., or "John-John," as her husband was often affectionately called, Bessette was the focus of much media attention. Declared a trendsetter by the national press, she was often compared to her late mother-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, because of her fierce protection of her own (and Kennedy's) privacy, as well as her work for charitable causes.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Death in Plane Crash</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Kennedy Jr., Bessette and her sister, Lauren, were killed when their small private plane, piloted by Kennedy, crashed off the coast of Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts, on July 16, 1999. Nearly two years later, the parents of Carolyn and Lauren Bessette received a monetary settlement as a result of their wrongful death lawsuit against the Kennedy estate.</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A&E Biography Special</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">July 16, 2019, marked the 20-year anniversary of Kennedy Jr. and Bessette's deaths. The two-hour documentary special, which aired on the anniversary, reframed the last year of his life in an entirely new way. Inspired by Steven M. Gillon’s upcoming book, America’s Reluctant Prince: The Life of John F. Kennedy Jr., this captivating special was the most substantive documentary to date and included convincing new evidence regarding his political aspirations before his untimely death. This compelling documentary shined an unexpectedly poignant light on 1999, his last year, as he coped with the fatal illness of his closest friend and cousin, Anthony Radziwill, struggled to save his marriage and tried to rescue his political magazine, George.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With the guidance of historian and longtime friend Steven M.
