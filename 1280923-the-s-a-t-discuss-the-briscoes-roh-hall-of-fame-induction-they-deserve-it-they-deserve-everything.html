(Jose and Joel Maximo) in a battle between two teams that often faced off in the early days of Ring of Honor. Given this previous history, the Maximos have a unique perspective on The Briscoes’ <a href=#>induction into the ROH Hall of Fame</a>.</p><p>During an appearance on <a href=# rel=noopener>The&nbsp;Shining Wizards Wrestling Podcast,&nbsp;</a>The S.A.T. looked back on their past battles with Mark and Jay Briscoe. The duo noted that their series of matches spans 16 or 17 bouts, and their competitive rivalry has been evenly-matched up to this point.</p><p><b>“</b>We actually did the math,” said Joel. “We wrestled the Briscoes 16 or 17 times.&nbsp; It’s ridiculous.&nbsp; And that’s not counting the shows we can’t remember.&nbsp; I see tapes sometimes, and I’m like “when did we wrestle them there?&nbsp; Like Idaho, somewhere.&nbsp; We wrestled them there?&nbsp; Oh I forgot. “What we can remember from, we’ve wrestled them 16 times.&nbsp; We beat them seven times, and they beat us seven times and we had like three draws.”</p><p>As for the brothers’ Hall of Fame induction, both Jose and Joel made it clear that Mark and Jay deserve the honor, as they have been loyal to <a href=#>ROH</a> from the start. The S.A.T. explained that it’s “the right move”, given the Briscoes’ impressive career in ROH.</p><p><b>“</b>That’s the right move,” said Joel. “Those boys have been there since day one, and they never left.&nbsp; When I think of Ring Of Honor, they’re the first ones I think of off the top of my head.&nbsp; A lot of guys went in there, and left, and came back, and left.&nbsp; The Briscoes stood, ya know?&nbsp; I think that was the right choice and they deserve it.&nbsp; Those boys deserve everything that they have coming to them.”</p><p><b>“</b>This is facts, right?&nbsp; They deserve it,” said Jose. ” They deserve everything.&nbsp; They’ve wrestled everyone and everybody.&nbsp; What are they like 12-time Ring Of Honor Champions?&nbsp; It’s ridiculous and unheard of.”</p><p>Fans can check out GCW Believe Me on February 19 to see the latest chapter in this lengthy rivalry. Plus, The Briscoes <a href=#>will defend</a> the ROH World Tag Team Championship at the promotion’s Supercard of Honor event on April 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFxZ3JqY2LBqbGMrGSaZaRisaq%2Fwq6qrGWknbJurtGiqpynlah6s7vHZp%2BapJxivKd5xZqknmWZo7G2r9OipqdlpJ2yunnDnqqeqqaaeqrAjK2fnrFdmbK0sdGvnGadppq%2FusDHoqWg</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
