Chesterton, featuring new mysteries for Father Brown to solve in every episode. While his partners, friends, and enemies have changed over the years, the priest remains steadfast in his quest for justice in the quaint fictional Cotswolds town of the 1950s.</p><h2 id=h-when-does-season-11-of-father-brown-come-out data-injectable=false>When does season 11 of Father Brown come out?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Father-Brown-4.jpg><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>In the United Kingdom, new episodes of Father Brown will be available starting January 5, 2024, at 1.45 pm GMT. Season 11 will feature ten episodes in total and presumably follow the same format as its predecessor. While before, episodes would air every weekday on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC One</a>, Season 10 adopted a different schedule, with weekly broadcasts paired with a full episode drop on the BBC iPlayer on the same day. Judging by the BBC One website’s Father Brown Episode Guide, Season 11 should follow suit.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>How can I watch Father Brown season 11 in the United States?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Father-Brown-5.jpg><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>BBC iPlayer is a UK-exclusive streaming service, so you would have to get around its geographical restrictions to access Father Brown.
