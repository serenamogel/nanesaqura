Westalis’ top spy, Codename: Twilight, has been assigned to spy on the elusive Donovan Desmond, the leader of Ostania’s National Unity Party. Twilight’s mission: Get close to the famous recluse by enrolling a child into the prestigious Eden College, having said child befriend Donovan’s son and score an invitation to the Desmond home.</p><p data-characters=787 data-current-count=787 data-injectable=true>Using the name Loid Forger, Twilight goes to an underground adoption agency and adopts who he thinks is the smartest child he’s ever met. Unbeknownst to him, she’s a telepath and does everything he expects of the “perfect child.” Twilight’s next step is to find a wife that won’t ask too many questions — enter Yor Briar, who happens to be looking for a “boyfriend” she can bring to a party to shut her friends up. Twilight only sees a shy but beautiful woman, but Anya’s telepathic abilities help her discovers Yor’s secret — she’s an assassin. Codename: Thorn Princess. A spy for a dad and an assassin for a mom is just about everything the cute little 007-obsessed Anya wants in parents and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">her hilarious reactions</a> to the craziness around her are everything.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=505 data-current-count=805 data-injectable=true>Despite there currently being only one season of the anime, which was based on the popular manga of the same name, there are more than enough episodes to make any number of lists, but this time, we’re counting down the best episodes. It will be a tough list to make because all the episodes are so great, but if we must rewatch every episode, we will make that “sacrifice.” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Crunchyroll </a>recently announced the second season will premiere sometime in 2023. Until then, here’s the best of season one.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>10. Disarm the Time Bomb</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=607 data-current-count=907 data-injectable=true>Anya discovers her new dog can see the future and Loid is about to die in terrorist-set explosion. Anya decides to save the day by disarming the bomb herself. After all, she’s watched enough spy movies to see how it’s done. The only problem is, the bomb doesn’t look like the ones in movies and she doesn’t know what to do, so she improvises. Seeing a bottle of ketchup on a table, she writes a message on the outside of the door, so that the bomb won’t be triggered when the door opens. Her plan works and she saves her new dad’s life, along with many more who would have died in the explosion.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>9. Operation Strix</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>The first episode of the series sets up the plot perfectly, giving viewers a glimpse into the life of a spy and the insane measures they must go through to get their guy. The episode also quickly introduces us to Anya, possibly the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">cutest little anime character</a> to ever grace our screens.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>8. Secure a Wife</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=339 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>He has the perfect child. Now Twilight just needs to find the perfect wife — one willing to pretend to be married so his new daughter can get into a private school. Forget love, fireworks and a romantic proposal. All Twilight and Yor needed was a grenade pin and explosions going off in the background to set the mood for their proposal.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>7. The Great Dodgeball Plan</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=938 data-current-count=1238 data-injectable=true>A big dodgeball game is set at Eden College and rumor has it that the MVP of the game will receive a coveted Stella award. Damien has his mind set on being named MVP so his dad will pay attention to him. Meanwhile, Anya tells Loid about the game and Yor agrees to teach the girl how to throw a ball. Anya learns firsthand how strong Yor is when she throws a dodgeball and it breaks a tree. In the dodgeball game, Anya is able to use her abilities to figure out where the other team’s humongous player is going to throw the ball to avoid being hit. Finally, Anya is able to use all the tips Yor taught her when throwing a ball. She stepped out firmly, twisted her hips while shifting her weight, transferred the force to her shoulders and threw — only to have the ball land about two feet away and continue to bounce to her opponent, who proceeded to hit her for the win. Anya’s ego was bruised, but the entire episode was hilarious.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>6. The Friendship Scheme</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=451 data-current-count=751 data-injectable=true>Their plan is working and it’s orientation day at school. Anya’s goal is to befriend Damien Desmond, but everything doesn’t go according to plan. Damien is a bully who vows to humiliate Anya every day for the rest of the school year. Anya does her best to smile off the boy’s threats, but she finally has enough and punches him square in the face. Loid is not happy about her actions, but Anya certainly let everyone know not to mess with her.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>5. The Prestigious School’s Interview</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=665 data-current-count=965 data-injectable=true>It’s interview day at the prestigious Eden College. The Forgers have prepared for all the interview questions and Loid knows there will be tricks around every corner as they arrive. He sees they are being watched as soon as they enter the gates and knows the interview has already begun. They impress the headmaster by stopping to pay respects to the statue of the school’s founder. While the headmaster watches the tests play out, the Forger family is ready for every contingency. They first help a boy stuck in the sewer, then a hoard of animals ready to plow down children. Never fear though, they brought a change of clothes. The hilarity is off the charts.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>4. A New Family Member</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=369 data-current-count=669 data-injectable=true>After getting made fun of at school for not having a name for her new dog, Anya comes up with the perfect name for her family pet – Bond. After decking him out in a bow tie collar, the dog looks like the perfect dog for the spy family. After naming him, feeding him and even showing him his litter box (for a dog?), she takes him on a tour of their little apartment.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>3. Nightfall/First Fit of Jealousy</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=650 data-current-count=950 data-injectable=true>A lot happens in this episode. After getting a new stuffed penguin, Anya watches a movie in which a penguin dies. The little girl is heartbroken and decides to sleep with her stuffed toy, leaving Bond jealous and heartbroken. When Anya wakes up the next day, the stuffed animal is torn to shreds and Anya knows Bond did it. After Loid and Yor stitch the penguin back together, Anya thinks he looks a little “Frankensteiny,” but Loid assures her that “Agent Penguin suffered honorable injuries in battle.” Afterward, Bond goes digging in the kitchen cabinet and brings Anya a bag of peanuts as an apology, since peanuts are her favorite snack.</p><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>In a separate storyline, Fiona Frost — Codename: Nightfall — shows up at the Forger residence to give Twilight some new information about his mission. Anya quickly realizes the woman is also a spy and then quickly realizes Nightfall is in love with her dad. Meanwhile, Fiona believes she should be playing Loid’s wife and would whip Anya into shape. Since Anya can see and hear her thoughts, she wants no part of her plans.</p><h2 data-injectable=false><strong>2. Will They Pass or Fail?</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=480 data-current-count=780 data-injectable=true>The Forger family awaits word on whether or not Anya was accepted into the prestigious school. When they finally get the call, Franky suggests they celebrate. Loid tells Anya she can have whatever she wants. Anya would like to reenact a scene from her favorite spy movie, so they rent a castle, call in reinforcements and Twilight shows why he is the best spy in the agency. This episode is based on a short scene from the manga that the writers used to develop an entire episode.</p><h2 id=h-1-prepare-for-the-interview data-injectable=false><strong>1. Prepare for the Interview</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=857 data-current-count=1157 data-injectable=false>This is the first episode viewers get a chance to see the Forger family all together, trying to make their fake relationship look real. They take family photos together, enjoy lunch and save a woman from being mugged. It is a simple episode but has a lot of memorable moments that solidify it as the best. One of the funniest moments of the entire series comes when they’re all walking down the street. Still having reservations about the entire fake family thing, Loid thinks it might actually work when Anya asks Yor to hold her hand. Yor excitedly grabs Anya’s hand, recalling a time when her little brother was still small and adorable. It’s a sweet moment that quickly turns hilarious when Yor remembers accidentally breaking two of her brother’s ribs while trying to hug him. A terrified Anya hides behind a bench in fear of her new momma.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6bnKysXai9unnXZp2apZmhxm6xz6KqqJyVqHqzrc2knJ1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
