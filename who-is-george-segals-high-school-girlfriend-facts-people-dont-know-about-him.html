After nearly fifty years, he married his high school girlfriend.</p><p>Segal and Greenbaum first met in George School in Bucks, Pennsylvania, and fell in love during their adolescence.</p><p>However, their time together was short-lived because the couple pursued different paths after graduation. Segal wanted to further his education, so he enrolled in college and later joined the military. He briefly served in the United States Army before pursuing a career in acting.</p><p>Before signing with Columbia Pictures, the Academy Award winner encountered a few stumbling blocks. He made his debut in The Young Doctors. Meanwhile, Greenbaum worked as a waitress in a New York Cafe.</p><p>During their time apart, the two enjoyed their respective lives and were busy raising their own families. While Greenbaum married her ex-husband and had three children, the veteran relished his marriage to his first wife, Freed.</p><h2>George Segal is already married twice a time</h2><p>On November 19, 1937, the Goldbergs actor married producer and screenwriter Freed. Polly and Elizabeth, their two daughters, were born to the couple. They were married for over 25 years before splitting up in 1963. (At the age of 77, Freed died from a terminal illness.)</p><p>After his divorce, the actor married Linda Sue Rogoff for the second time on October 9, 1983. In this relationship, the vows of “until death do us part” came true when he lost Rogoff to a terminal illness in 1996.</p><p>Segal was devastated by Rogoff’s death. He was at his “lowest point” when he received an invitation to his 45th high school reunion party. As a result, he declined the offer, potentially ruining any chance of rekindling his adolescent romance.</p><p>“I declined the invitation because I was at the lowest point of my roller-coaster life. With Linda’s death, I lost interest in everything. I worked to make a living. Acting, like life, became a chore. As a result, I was unable to attend the high school reunion”</p><h2>Greenbaum’s Relationship Has Been Rekindled</h2><p>The organizers of the reunion party wanted the actor to attend, so they asked Greenbaum to persuade him to come.<br>After she contacted him, the two talked for hours and became acquainted. Additionally, the veteran actor stated that reminiscing about their old times with her made him feel better.</p><p>It was magical. It was like all that spiritual stuff I’d heard about, but when it happens in your life, you believe in miracles. She restored the joy in my life. They married on <strong>September 28, 1998,</strong> after rekindling their childhood romance.</p><h2>George Segal Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>George is one of the&nbsp;richest Movie Actors & is listed as the most popular Movie Actor.
