And welcome to my latest game:<br><b><u>Pokemon Generation Spin-Off Mafia!</u></b><br>Now I know the title isn't too great, but I wanted to keep the generation tag as that is what some of my games using the HP mechanic (more on this later) have been called for simplicities sake. There's not really any flavour or backstory to this one really, it's just another mafia game where I can use the rules from my previous generation games. Now it's been a long time since I hosted this variant (for lack of a better term) of mafia, people have come and gone, people might have forgotten what it's about, people might be thinking, "What is Calvin waffling about HP mechanics for??"... But rest assured all is explained in the spoilers below, and as always and forever, feel free to ask anything you don't know, things I may not have explained properly, etc etc. I won't take offense to anything asked as I know it can be a bit confusing sometimes.<p>What separates this game from a normal mafia game is that it uses the aforementioned HP mechanic, a type-effectiveness system, as well as not having typical lynches. Instead, for lynches, we will be using a system where votes subtract HP from their target. For example, if one person voted for Calvin, but two people voted for Calvin-Bot, then Calvin would take 1HP damage, and Calvin-Bot would take 2HP damage. (Not taking into voting modifiers, should they exist.) I will not speak for night kills and whether they exist or not. In this game, most players will have a night action that typically, is a move but could be something else. Not everyone is guaranteed a night action. When you use this action, usually to attack someone, you will deal the damage specified in the role PM. This attack, unlike voting, takes into account the type chart of Pokemon. If you use a 2HP attack and it is not very effective, you will deal 1HP damage, but if it's super effective you'll double your damage, doing 4HP damage! The type effectiveness is only 0.5x and 2x (and no effect). So no 4x effectiveness with moves. 0.5x effectiveness is rounded down in most situations, except for if the damage is reduced to &lt;1, in which case it will always be 1HP at least. A NVE 3HP move will deal 1HP damage, a 1HP NVE move will deal 1HP also.</p><p>A quick warning before we go into the rules, there are no guarantees that any moves or abilities do the same that they do in the main series games, or the spin-off games. Also, abilities and moves <b><u>should not</u></b> be taken as gospel to indicate that any other role exists. (Random example, you have Levitate, this should not <i>necessarily </i>be taken as an indication that a ground type exists.)</p><p><b><u>Previous Generation Games</u></b><br><a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fforums.bulbagarden.net%2Findex.php%3Fthreads%2Fpokemon-generation-one-mafia-endgame-19-04.214727%2F&hash=39fd3c8b89d0a6e915e21d1082b8f589" rel=noopener>I</a> <a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fforums.bulbagarden.net%2Findex.php%3Fthreads%2Fpokemon-generation-two-mafia-night-eight.224053%2F&hash=fbe50698d97c3665c15d1309dea6ff7e" rel=noopener>II </a><a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fforums.bulbagarden.net%2Findex.php%3Fthreads%2Fpokemon-generation-three-mafia-endgame-mafia-indep-win.268178%2F&hash=df3ccace012015e0d0875ed7e8f91dd5" rel=noopener>III </a><a href=# class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="./proxy.php?link=https%3A%2F%2Fforums.bulbagarden.net%2Findex.php%3Fthreads%2Fpokemon-generation-four-mafia-endgame.279328%2F&hash=33bf3f52241ad0dd23b39e8cc0543f4e" rel=noopener>IV</a></p><p>​</p><br>Here are a couple of roles from past games that you can look at, so you get an idea of what a role PM looks like!<br><span class=button-text><span>Spoiler: <span class=bbCodeSpoiler-button-title>DawningWinds' Bronzor from Gen IV!</span></span></span> Dear DawningWinds, <img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/bulbagarden.net/proxy.php?image=https%3A%2F%2Fforums.bulbagarden.net%2Findex.php%3Fattachments%2F1584497518584-png.131731%2F&hash=cf0bd32d70bb03b454649ee511acd345" data-url=https://forums.bulbagarden.net/index.php?attachments/1584497518584-png.131731/ data-zoom-target=1 alt=1584497518584.png title=1584497518584.png width height style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>You are <b>Bronzor, the Bronze Pokemon!</b></p><p>You are a Steel / Psychic type introduced in Generation IV.
