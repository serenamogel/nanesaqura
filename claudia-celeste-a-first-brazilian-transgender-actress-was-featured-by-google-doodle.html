She did, however, go on to get a beauty certificate at the age of 20. In Rio de Janeiro, she started her profession as a hairdresser. This was the time in her life when she decided to make a change.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Claudia-Celeste.jpg alt="Cláudia Celeste" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Claudia’s given name was Carlos Imperial, but she was given the stage name Cláudia Celeste when she entered the theater. She afterward worked as a dancer in many nightclubs.&nbsp;After acquiring government permission to exhibit O Mundo é das Bonecas, a theater spotted Claudia’s work and asked her, along with other transgender actresses, to play. Celeste started to be acknowledged for her abilities after the success of her theatrical presentations.</p><p>She was crowned Miss Brazil Pop in 1976. A year later, she debuted on the soap opera circuit with a production called Magic Mirror. At the time, few people were aware that Claudia was transgender, but the news spread quickly. Although the program was canceled, she continued her profession.</p><p>Her major break came from the soap drama Ohlo Por Ohlo. Claudia was able to be true to herself and appear on film as a trans woman. While she faced discrimination from management once they discovered she was transsexual, the chance offered new options for her.&nbsp;She died on May 13, 2018, in Brazil, due to pneumonia, after a fruitful career.</p><h2>Claudia will be remembered on August 22nd.</h2><p>The Google Doodle served as a reminder that Claudia was chosen above 200 other candidates for her part in Ohlo Por Ohlo. Her dedication to the role and the program was unrivaled. She was rather outspoken about her beliefs.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Claudia-Celeste-2.jpg alt="Cláudia Celeste" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>She overcame prejudice in the creative field. Claudia is currently well-known for her work in the television opera business. Furthermore, she is regarded for paving the way for future generations of LGBTQ+ talent who want to pursue the sector.&nbsp;Claudia’s tremendous career and the manner she accepted her LGBTQ+ identity were honored in a Google Doodle on August 22, 2022. Without a doubt, she is a huge influence to future generations.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiapZmlmbaiecKeo56rpJp6onnFoqmsrF2Xv6LGyKWgmqZdqb%2BiutKgnKeclad6oq%2FTq5ysq12srrR5xZ6Yra2imrFurthmnqinl6GybrDOqJulnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
