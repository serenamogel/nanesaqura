Event organizers upload player event information that may then be viewed on the <a href=# title=Pokémon.com>Pokémon.com</a> website by players if players also create a <a href=#>Pokémon Trainer Club</a> account, including a player's Rankings, <a href=# title="Premier Ratings (TCG)">Premier Ratings</a>, Tournaments (for <a href=# title="Tournament Organizer (TCG)">Tournament Organizers</a> only), or Leagues (for <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="League Leader (TCG)">League Leaders</a> only). After setting up a Pokémon Trainer Club account and linking that account to the player's ID, organized play information is accessed by going to <i>"My Profile"</i> under the <a href=# title=Pokémon.com>Pokémon.com Pokémon Trainer Club</a> section of the website and selecting <i>"Play! Pokémon Settings"</i> and then <i>"My Play!

These were defined by a specific age up until the 2006-2007 season, consisting of Ten and Under (10-), Eleven to Fourteen (11-14), and Fifteen and Over (15+). Beginning with the 2006-2007 season, the system was revised to be based on year of birth, to avoid the issues of a player shifting divisions in the middle of a tournament season.</p><p>Originally the Video Game Championship series used only two age divisions, but as of 2012 both the Trading Card Game and Video Game series have been unified to use the same age division structure.</p><p>As of July 5, 2020, the three age divisions are defined as follows:</p><ul><li><b>Junior Division</b>: Born in 2009 or later</li><li><b>Senior Division</b>: Born in 2005, 2006, 2007, or 2008</li><li><b>Masters Division</b>: Born in 2004 or earlier</li></ul><p>These age divisions apply for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons, due to the cancellation of the 2019-2020 season, and the subsequent decision to allow accumulation of Championship Points across both seasons.</p><p>These divisions are officially adjusted when the new tournament season begins, around mid-July each year, sometime between the conclusion of National Championships worldwide and the start of the <a href=# title="World Championships">Pokémon World Championships</a>. However, the World Championships are considered part of the previous tournament season and use its age division years.</p><h2><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Leagues></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Leagues>Pokémon Leagues</span></h2><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/9/91/League_logo.png decoding=async width=173 height=197 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Pokémon League logo <i>Main article: <a href=# title="Pokémon League (TCG)">Pokémon League (TCG)</a></i><p>Pokémon Leagues provide a nearby place for players to get together with other fans of the <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game">Pokémon Trading Card Game</a> and <a href=# title="Pokémon games">Pokémon games</a> and have fun. They are often held in public locations, such as stores, community centers and libraries. Leagues are often the perfect venues for players starting out to learn about the TCG or video games and to hone their skills to compete in tournaments.</p><p>Leagues often focus on a theme related to the current video game every year, and break the cycle down into seven or eight seasons lasting around six weeks, each season representing a part of the theme (e.g. a specific <a href=# title=Gym>Gym</a> if the theme is based around Gyms featured in a Pokémon game). The theme often correlates with the current main series Pokémon games.</p><p><b>List of themes featured in Pokémon TCG Leagues</b></p><p>During Wizards' tenure, players received points based on actions at every League session, and these points were recorded in League books. Points were awarded for actions such as challenging a player, winning/losing a battle, trading cards, meeting new individuals and promoting good sportsmanship.</p><p>Unlike Wizards, Play! Pokémon utilized a hybrid League system during the 2003-2004 season, where players could earn points by playing both the video games and the Trading Card Game. The idea was scrapped for the next cycle, though it since has made a comeback.</p><p><b>Typical prizes:</b> When a player reaches the Poké Ball symbol or the badge symbol on their <a href=# title="Pokémon League (TCG)">Score Card</a>, they receive (a) promotional foil card(s). Once an entire side is filled, the player will receive a promotional Nintendo DS Lite/DSi skin. Some Leagues have a different system of handing these items out.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Player_Rewards_Program>Player Rewards Program</span></h2><p>This allows players who compete in Leagues, Tournaments and Premier Events to earn rewards for their efforts. Attending one of these will earn players 1 "credit". Each credit is a step toward a Rewards "Tier." At the end of each quarter, Play! Pokémon distributes the Player Rewards to those that have earned them through the mail. At one time, player who played in 3–5 events qualified for Tier One and earn 5 POP booster packs; 6–10 events qualified for Tier Two, earning 10 packs, and 11 events or more qualify for Tier Three and earned 15 packs. Thus, players could earn up to 15 POP Booster packs each quarter (three months).</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=POP_packs>POP packs</span></h3><p><b>POP packs</b> were special <a href=# title="Pokémon Trading Card Game">Pokémon TCG</a> <a href=# title="Booster pack (TCG)">Booster packs</a> that only contained two cards. Introduced in September 2004, the POP sets were released roughly once every six months until September 2009. There were nine POP sets in total: <a href=# title="POP Series 1 (TCG)">Series 1</a>, <a href=# title="POP Series 2 (TCG)">Series 2</a>, <a href=# title="POP Series 3 (TCG)">Series 3</a>, <a href=# title="POP Series 4 (TCG)">Series 4</a>, <a href=# title="POP Series 5 (TCG)">Series 5</a>, <a href=# title="POP Series 6 (TCG)">Series 6</a>, <a href=# title="POP Series 7 (TCG)">Series 7</a>, <a href=# title="POP Series 8 (TCG)">Series 8</a> and <a href=# title="POP Series 9 (TCG)">Series 9</a>, each with 17 cards, plus variants. They were created to bring useful cards that had been <a href=# title="Rotation (TCG)">rotated</a> out of play back into the game, as well as exclusive cards. With an increasing number of alternate-art Promo cards in Japan, the latest POP sets also served as a means of releasing them in English. The usefulness of these sets had been the subject of debate within the Pokémon community; collectors praising PUSA for bringing these cards to the west, while they faced scrutiny by players, as many cards were the same as those in the current Modified format.</p><p>Initially, POP packs could only be acquired by participating in Pokémon Organized Play events, but after leagues no longer distributed them, they were often included in Value Packs, etc. sold in stores.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Player_of_the_Year>Player of the Year</span></h3><p>Beginning with the 2011-2012 season, the TCG player in each age division who attained the most <b>Play! Points</b> during the season was awarded the title <b>Player of the Year</b> and rewarded with two boxes of each set released during the next year. Award winners were:</p><table class=roundy><tbody><tr><th>Season</th><th>Junior</th><th>Senior</th><th>Master</th></tr><tr><th>2011-12</th><th>Cory Connor</th><th>Laurens van Brecht</th><th>Bruce Long</th></tr><tr><th>2012-13</th><th>Sydney M.</th><th>Emily Grieve</th><th>Gawein Wagner</th></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Local_Tournaments>Local Tournaments</span></h2><p>Local Tournaments are meant for both fun and practice. They are usually held once a week in a gaming store or other large hall such as a church by a local <a href=# title="Pokémon League (TCG)">League Leader</a> or <a href=# title="Tournament Organizer (TCG)">Tournament Organizer</a>. Prizes vary depending on the competitors. They are often free to enter, but organizers may charge a reasonable entry fee.</p><p>Play! Pokémon sanctioned tournaments are either single elimination, Swiss, or Swiss followed by single elimination rounds. Events in which attendance does not reach six players in every age division use 'Age Modified Swiss', (a variation of Swiss invented by Play! Pokémon) in which age divisions are mixed together and a player's age division takes priority over the player's record when the organizer pairs players.</p><p>After sanctioned tournaments are completed, the Tournament Organizer uploads the results of each match to <a href=# title="The Pokémon Company International">The Pokémon Company International</a> (abbreviated to TPCi) via Play! Pokémon. The results of each match are used to calculate a player's <a href=# title="Premier Ratings (TCG)">Premier Rating</a>. Play! Pokémon Ratings are based on the <a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Elo rating system">Elo rating system</a>.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Typical_prizes>Typical prizes</span></h3><p>In early seasons, players could earn Promotional cards by participating in league sessions.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Prerelease_Tournaments>Prerelease Tournaments</span></h2><p>Prerelease Tournaments are events in which players get the opportunity to play with cards from an Expansion that will be released in stores prior to the event. They are typically held on the two weekends before the set release (although a third weekend is added to the schedule if the Prerelease clashes with a major Play! Pokémon event, such as the World Championships, traditionally held in August). The fee is a minimum of $25 and each player gets four Booster packs, a 22-cards pack, and a foil black-star promo. Players may build a 40-card deck using the cards opened out of the given packs (not including basic Energy cards, which are provided at the event). If the player vouches to participate in this event, they receive additional booster packs at the end of the event.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=TCG_Premier_Events>TCG Premier Events</span></h2><p>Premier Events are tournaments held throughout the year, offering opportunities to earn invitations to the World Championships held each August. Invitations to the World Championships could be earned, in season, by a player's <a href=# title="Premier Ratings (TCG)">Premier Ratings</a> from 2003-2010. Each player's Premier Rating would go up and down as wins and losses were accumulated, calculated by a factor called a <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="K-Value (TCG)">K-Value</a>. In 2011, the system changed to allow only the top players in each regional zone to be invited based on <a href=# title="Championship Point">Championship Points</a> accumulated throughout the 2011-2012 season.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=League_Challenges>League Challenges</span></h3><i>Main article: <a href=# title="League Challenge (TCG)">League Challenge (TCG)</a></i><p>League challenges are the smallest level of currently active Pokémon TCG Premier Events. These are run by local leagues, and are intended as an entry-level event for new players who attend the local league. These events typically attract roughly 8 to 30 players, and run Swiss format with no top cut. These tournaments offer up to 15 Championship Points, as well as unique Promotional Cards for the top finishers.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=League_Cups>League Cups</span></h3><i>Main article: <a href=# title="League Cup (TCG)">League Cup (TCG)</a></i><p>Leagues Cups are the second smallest level of currently active Pokémon TCG Premier Events. These are also held by local leagues, however they are only available to leagues with a trusted record of successful turnout at events. These events are considered more prestigious than League Challenges, and will often attract a larger number of players to attend. These tournaments offer up to 50 Championship points, as well as unique Promotional cards and Play Mats for the top finishers.</p><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Regional_Championships>Regional Championships</span></h3><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/3/32/Regional_Championship_logo.png/450px-Regional_Championship_logo.png decoding=async width=300 height=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Regional Championships logo<p>First introduced in 2005, this event divides countries into large regions and pits players against each other in order to become the Regional champion.
