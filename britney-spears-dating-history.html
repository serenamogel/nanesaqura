"I thought he was really adorable and she said he was good to people, so I went for it," Spears told <a href=#>People</a> magazine of her new romance. The two really bonded, and Spears loved that Ebersol knew how to cook. Before long, she introduced him to her boys, and things seemed to be really serious. At one point, she even incorporated their relationship into her Las Vegas residency at Planet Hollywood, wearing a vest that read "I heart Charlie" on stage. After eight months of what seemed like pure bliss, Spears and Ebersol ended their relationship. As for what went wrong, well, rumor has it that Spears' dad had something to do with it.</p><p>"Jamie doesn't want Britney getting married again. He doesn't want a man coming in and dismantling the work that he and others have done to get Britney in the place where she is now," a source told <a href=#>Hollywood Life</a> after Spears' split from Ebersol was reported. "Jamie liked Charlie, but never in a million years thought his relationship with Britney would be this intense. Every man she's been with, she's wanted to marry: Adnan, Jason, David, and now Charlie. Jamie didn't break them up, though. He simply talked to Britney. He reminded her of her past and warned her what could happen if she were to marry Charlie,"&nbsp;the source added. And so, another relationship ended in heartbreak for the pop star.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxhbn56hY6bqaKsnprGbr%2FPnpirq12ZrrW1zaBkoaGjqbyzxY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
