With a cancelled season 13 reunion and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement of an all-new cast</a>, the arrival of this year’s installment after a two-year hiatus could have been disastrous for one of Bravo’s most treasured franchises.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=337 data-current-count=337 data-injectable=false>However, thanks to the network’s expert casting and refreshing take on life in the Big Apple,&nbsp;RHONY’s current season has largely delivered on all the staples of compelling Housewifery, from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lavish new castmates</a> like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenna Lyons</a>, to arguments about cheese platters and quarrels over the correct time to serve <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">shakshuka for breakfast</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=637 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Aside from those antics, the season’s most eyebrow-raising incident occurred in the most recent fifth episode, when castmate Jessel Taank told fellow housewife Erin Lichy that the NYC neighbourhood of Tribeca was “up and coming.” It’s a statement that would confuse even non-New Yorkers, and one that took Lichy — a real estate agent and Tribeca resident herself — totally by surprise.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=501 data-injectable=true>So where exactly does Jessel Taank live? And how does it compare to her fellow castmates’ zip codes?</p><h2 id=h-where-does-jessel-taank-live data-injectable=false>Where does Jessel Taank live?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=439 data-current-count=739 data-injectable=true>Taank — a fashion publicist and brand consultant — resides in the neighbourhood of Chelsea, in the Upper West Side of New York City’s Manhattan borough. Fittingly for the creative, Chelsea is home to some of NYC’s best art galleries, which might explain why Taank welcomed trendsetting guests like Vogue editor Lynn Yaeger to her home in the latest episode. Taank described Chelsea as “one of [her] favorite areas in the city.”</p><h2 data-injectable=false>What does Jessel Taank’s apartment look like?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=653 data-injectable=true>Upon the season fourteen premiere of RHONY, Taank took Bravo on a tour of her Chelsea apartment, which was built in 1887. The building was once used as a dried goods emporium, but now houses Taank’s neutral-colored apartment with panoramic views of the city. Taank designed the apartment herself, including a walk-in closet befitting a fashion mogul.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Where do Jessel Taank’s castmates live?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=497 data-current-count=797 data-injectable=false>Taank’s description of Tribeca as an “up and coming” neighbourhood with “potential” attracted the most ire from Lichey, which is understandable given that she is a real estate agent and Tribeca resident. Elsewhere, fellow castmate Jenna Lyons lives in a loft apartment in SoHo, while content creator Sai De Silva resides in Brooklyn.&nbsp;Meanwhile, housewife <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Brynn Whitfield</a> lives in an apartment in the West Village, a stone’s throw away from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubah Hassan</a>’s home in Columbus Circle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnGacn5rAbrbErKqepF2htrexjKilZqqYpLu6ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
