The latest one to join the list is his old interview from 2012 where he calls himself ‘DJ Donkey Punch’ – a name that was up one of the two sexual assault victims to address the actor during his last court hearing.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=180 data-injectable=false>If you are wondering what significance the name holds, let us tell you that it is right along the lines of all the sickening actions Masterson has been accused and found guilty of.</p><h2 id=h-what-does-donkey-punch-mean data-injectable=false>What does ‘Donkey Punch’ mean?</h2><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>In short, the term is a violent sexual slang and yes, Masterson was well aware of it when he made jokes about sexual assault on the Kevin Pollak Chat Show back in 2012.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=655 data-injectable=true>While the past uploads of the video have been pulled down, a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh one has been put up again</a> and its most problematic aspects have been pointed out in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> post. But what gives the accusations against the That 70s Show star a whole new significance is his self-proclaimed title of DJ Donkey Punch.</p><p data-characters=721 data-current-count=721 data-injectable=true>The term implies a violent tactic where during intercourse, one lands a hard punch to the back of their partner’s head, neck, or ribs, which causes the back muscles to contract sharply. In the interview, Masterson jokes about using the name when he was presumably not aware of its true “so violent” meaning. The Redditor has also highlighted the part where he answers the question about how to make a move on a girl after you get them to your place and his saying that the best way is to “invite them for a shower” is a stomach-churning reminder of the accusation by one of the sexual assault victims who revealed how she was intoxicated, possibly drugged, and then assaulted by Masterson in the shower.</p><p data-characters=154 data-current-count=154 data-injectable=false>As reported by legal affairs journalist Meghann Cuniff (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Independent</a>), one of the victims brought up this name as she addressed Masterson in court.</p><p>“You relish in hurting women. It is your addiction. It is without question your favourite thing to do.”</p><p data-characters=141 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=false>If you know someone suffering from sexual violence, contact&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RAINN</a>&nbsp;or the National Sexual Abuse Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqcWMoZisZZSWu6%2FFjKaYrKyVp8CwutJmm6Nlnpa6pnnDqKWknalivba6wqFkq52jqr%2BnrcKem2aZnZ6xbrTIrGSsnaiqrq15wKyqmq2cqXqku82voJysmaS7bq3NnWSwoJGpeqW7xKxkoqxdorKiuo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
