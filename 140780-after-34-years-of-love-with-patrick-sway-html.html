However, she finally began a new chapter in her romantic life when she married Albert DePrisco in 2014.</p><p class=dh>Patrick Swayze and Lisa Niemi had an endearing love story many admired through the years. Both with incredible talents, the couple made headlines as the perfect match.</p><p class=dh>Together, they built a great relationship and marriage that withstood many tests, survived many challenges, and remained firmly in love with each other till death pulled them apart. Niemi was left broken after Swayze's demise but eventually opened her heart to another man after several years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/dc208a0a393c83933d7b8185e7eeac99.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Patrick Swayze dances with Lisa Niemi during the 1994 World Music Awards on May 4, 1994 in Monte Carlo, Monaco. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER</strong></p><p class=dh>Swayze and Niemi met when the actor was only 18 years old. After dating for five years, the pair decided to tie the knot in 1975. They stayed together without children for the next 34 years. Sadly, Swayze was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/PatrickSwayze/patrick-swayzes-death-shows-tough-pancreatic-cancer/story?id=8583819">diagnosed</a> with pancreatic cancer in 2008 and was given only five months to live.</p><p class=dh>He outlived his given timeline by 15 months with the help of chemotherapy and a relatively healthy lifestyle, but eventually, the inevitable happened, and he succumbed to the terrible disease.</p><p class=dh>Niemi, who stood by him throughout his battle and pain, was devastated by her husband's passing. With her longtime friend and partner gone, it was hard to see the dancer have someone to heal her heart. However, fate had other plans and brought her to cross paths with Albert DePrisco.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a68be6fb8004155b438ab6bf48b9dcc7282251553291184.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Patrick and Lisa Swayze on February 17, 2007 in Beverly Hills, California | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>OPENING HER HEART TO ALBERT</strong></p><p class=dh>Niemi would spend the years following her soulmate's death alone and sober, much to the detestation of her friends. They found a way out for her and introduced her to DePrisco, a jeweler. The widow's heart opened up to him, and she felt butterflies in her stomach after so many years.</p><p class=dh>When he popped the question in 2013, however, she was unsure she would be able to marry another man after Swayze. In a previous interview, Niemi <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.people.com/article/lisa-niemi-wedding-photos-albert-deprisco-patrick-swayze>shared</a> her thoughts:</p><p class=dh>“I have to say that the love I have for Patrick was never in conflict or competition with my feelings for Albert. That is until Albert asked me to marry him!”</p><p class=dh>DePrisco understood how she felt and wanted to make her happy without overshadowing her life with Swayze. Still, the thought of marrying another man clouded Niemi's head for a while until <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/lisa-niemi-marries-albert-deprisco-see-the-photos/>taking</a> "a leap of faith" and accepting the proposal.</p><p class=dh>According to Niemi, her boyfriend knew that her love for Swayze would never change nor fade. Despite the fact that he loved her and knew that she also loved him. Another thing that helped Niemi decide was when her late husband visited her through a dream and gave his blessing. She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/lisa-niemi-marries-albert-deprisco-see-the-photos/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>“It can be hard sometimes to take those steps forward, but it doesn’t change the way we feel about someone. He was letting me know that.”</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE BIG DAY</strong></p><p class=dh>DePrisco and Niemi tied the knot in 2014, both at 58. The blonde Lisa looked beautiful and elegant in an Oscar de la Renta gown, while the groom looked dapper in an Ermenegildo Zegna dinner jacket.</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>Niemi was beside Swayze when he passed away in their Los Angeles ranch.

The couple's family also participated in the planning as Niemi's nephew and his wife put together the string quartet playlist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b040d67e82ec7fa1c2e36acdc162c117.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Actor Patrick Swayze and his wife Lisa Niemi attend the Elton John AIDS Foundation's 12th Annual Oscar party co-hosted by In Style at the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel on February 29, 2004 in Hollywood, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>The reception was particularly something all 50 guests looked forward to as the newlywed performed a special dance number, choreographed by DePrisco's professional ballroom dancer sister.</p><p class=dh>Niemi, a professional dancer herself, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/lisa-niemi-marries-albert-deprisco-see-the-photos/>shared</a>: "Albert was concerned about looking good in the dance, but he has natural rhythm and is a great mover -- much more than he knows!" She knew that looking deep into each other's eyes during the dance would help them perform well, and at the end, everyone applauded.</p><p class=dh>The evening was filled with everyone dancing to a diverse playlist which included songs from the seventies and hits from Steve Tyrell and Michael Buble.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/c714202824c706d8e2bab0f1c0622948.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Patrick Swayze and Lisa Niemi at the Los Angeles Premiere Of "Inland Empire" held at the LACMA Museum on December 9, 2006 in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>FOREVER IN HER HEART</strong></p><p class=dh>Niemi may have begun a new chapter in her life, but her connection to Swayze remains the same. In a previous interview, she revealed that her late husband continues to be in her life. "When you move past the extreme pain of losing someone you love, you actually become close in a different way," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://celebrity.nine.com.au/latest/patrick-swayze-widow-lisa-niemi-swayze-feels-his-presence/75dabe63-fe51-4b1f-afa2-6f91ae06f4de>said</a>.</p><p class=dh>According to Niemi, the actor still appears in her dreams, and memories with him will never fade, as she initially feared. On one occasion, Niemi was driving while listening to the radio. Suddenly "Wayfaring Stranger" started playing to Emmylou Harris's voice.</p><p class=dh>"I really got that he's just on the other side," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://celebrity.nine.com.au/latest/patrick-swayze-widow-lisa-niemi-swayze-feels-his-presence/75dabe63-fe51-4b1f-afa2-6f91ae06f4de>said</a> of Swayze. "Almost so close I could touch him." Niemi was beside Swayze when he passed away at their Los Angeles ranch. Right as he died, she left a white rose on his chest.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>PATRICK SWAYZE'S LIFE</strong></p><p class=dh><a class="me a" href=#>Swayze</a> made a name for himself in Hollywood and became the "Sexiest Man Alive" in 1991. His talent ran in his veins as his mother was a dance teacher who founded the Houston Jazz Ballet Company. Naturally, he took ballet and dancing before becoming an actor.</p><p class=dh>Before becoming a professional, Swayze trained at the prestigious Joffrey Ballet. He later danced with the Eliot Feld Ballet Company and landed parts on Broadway. His most recognized on-screen role remains "Dirty Dancing." Despite his demise, Swayze left a legacy in the world of dance and acting.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpraW9oZXqistOeqWZrZGLGpq3RrGSonl2hvLexjLCgraBdpa61vsicomarp5bGb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
