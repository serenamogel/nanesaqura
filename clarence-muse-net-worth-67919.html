He was acting in New York by the 1920s, during the Harlem Renaissance with two Harlem theatres, Lincoln Players and Lafayette Players.</p><span>1929</span><p>Muse moved to Chicago for a while, and then moved to Hollywood and performed in <i>Hearts in Dixie</i> (1929), the first all-black movie. For the next fifty years, he worked regularly in minor and major roles. While with the Lafayette Players, Muse worked under the management of <a href=#>Producer</a> Robert Levy on productions that helped black actors to gain prominence and respect. In regards to the Lafayette Theatre's staging of <i>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</i>, Muse said the play was relevant to black actors and audiences "because, in a way, it was every black man's story. Black men too have been split creatures inhabiting one body.". Muse appeared as an opera singer, minstrel show performer, vaudeville and Broadway actor; he also wrote songs, plays, and sketches. In 1943, he became the first <a href=#>African</a> <a href=#>American</a> Broadway <a href=#>Director</a> with <i>Run Little Chillun</i>.</p><span>1931</span><p>Muse was also the co-writer of several notable songs. In 1931, with Leon RenÃ© and Otis RenÃ©, Muse wrote "When It's Sleepy Time Down South", also known as "Sleepy Time Down South". The song was sung by <a href=#>Nina Mae McKinney</a> in the movie <i>Safe in Hell</i> (1931), and later became a signature song of Louis Armstrong.</p><span>1936</span><p>He was the major star in <i>Broken Earth</i> (1936), which related the story of a black sharecropper whose son miraculously recovers from fever through the father's fervent prayer. Shot on a farm in the South with nonprofessional actors (except for Muse), the film's early scenes focused in a highly realistic manner on the incredible hardship of black farmers, with plowing scenes. In 1938, Muse co-starred with boxer Joe Louis in <i>Spirit of Youth</i>, the fictional story of a champion boxer which featured an all black cast. Muse and Langston Hughes wrote the script for <i>Way Down South</i> (1939).</p><span>1940</span><p>Muse performed in <i>Broken Strings</i> (1940), as a concert <a href=#>Violinist</a> who opposes the <a href=#>Desire</a> of his son to play "swing". From 1955-56, Muse was a regular on the weekly TV version of <i>Casablanca</i>, playing Sam the <a href=#>Pianist</a> (a part he was under consideration for in the original Warner Brothers film), and in 1959, he played Peter, the Honey Man, in <i>Porgy and Bess</i>.</p><span>1972</span><p>He appeared on Disney's TV miniseries <i>The Swamp Fox</i>. Other film credits include <i>Buck and the Preacher</i> (1972), <i>The World's Greatest Athlete</i> (1973) and as Gazenga's Assistant, "Snapper" in <i>Car Wash</i> (1976). His last acting role was in <i>The Black Stallion</i> (1979).</p><span>1979</span><p>He received an honorary <a href=#>Doctor</a> of humanities degree from Bishop College, Dallas, Texas, in 1972, and was a member of Phi Beta Sigma fraternity, Omega Chapter. Muse died in Perris, <a href=#>California</a>, on October 13, 1979, one day before his 90th birthday and the same day that his final film was released.</p><h2>Tags:</h2><a href=#>1889 births</a> <a href=#>1979 deaths</a> <a href=#>American male film actors</a> <a href=#>African-American male actors</a> <a href=#>Male actors from Baltimore</a> <a href=#>20th-century American male actors</a> <a href=#>Writers from Baltimore</a> <a href=#>Disease-related deaths in California</a> <a href=#>Dickinson College alumni</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeToa6zsc2cnGalpaiybrrErWSwp6KptW6ClnJocg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
