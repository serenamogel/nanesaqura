Gunther and Barthel moved to WWE SmackDown in April 2022 before Aichner, who had been renamed Giovanni Vinci, joined them at WWE Clash at the Castle. The trio has been a prominent part of WWE programming ever since.</p><p>Speaking with Steve Fall for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WrestlingNewsCo</a>, WWE Intercontinental Champion Gunther was asked about potentially adding new members to Imperium.</p><p>“We get that question asked quite a lot, to be honest. We always have to give the answers like, no, I think it’s perfect how it is, and I’m a big believer in, ‘Never change a running system.’ I think too much in and outs can water a group down a little bit, if that makes sense, and I think we’ll all together for a reason. Nothing’s random there.</p><p>“We are all tightly connected in our private lives too, especially with Kaiser. Our careers went the same way since we started. So there a history of the group long time before WWE, so it’s something that was just authentically there, and yeah, as of right now, I feel like it’s good how it is.”</p><p>Gunther and his stablemates were selected by WWE RAW in the 2023 WWE Draft. Kaiser and Gunther lost to Undisputed WWE Tag Team Champions Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn on the June 12 episode of WWE RAW.</p><p>WrestleZone will have coverage of WWE SmackDown as it airs on June 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJxZ2xwYmK0trrToZyrZZOkuq6xza2qZqeeYr2wwMSnq6KZnKHGbq3DnaCnn12jsrh5zJ6km52iqHq1u4yipKmdop7Crg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
