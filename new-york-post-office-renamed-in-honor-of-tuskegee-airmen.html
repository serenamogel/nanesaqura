The men faced massive racial discrimination as they served their country.</p><p>100-year-old Wilfred DeFour,&nbsp;an aircraft technician of the Tuskegee Airmen, attended the ceremony. He said at the time he and the others didn’t know they were making history, but “were just doing our job.”</p><p>“I regret so many of my comrades are no longer here with us,” said DeFour, who worked as a postal&nbsp;employee for more than 30 years after serving in the military.</p><p>Espaillat told the New York Daily News, “They were really known for breaking racial barriers in the military, and were active in fighting against Jim Crow in the South.”</p><p>He added, “It is a fitting tribute to honor their memory and contribution to this country.”</p>Korean War veteran and&nbsp;Espaillat’s predecessor, former Rep. Charles Rangel, said the&nbsp;post office honor is exactly what the country in general needed.<p>“Can you imagine our country being attacked by Japanese, Italians and Germans, and through the poison of racism and segregation a group of human beings of color have to fight for the right to defend this nation?” said Rangel. “Oh, no. We needed this.”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX55e5BqZmtuX6OyuHnYqKmkZaCkwLV5zp%2BdopuVYr%2BmusCmnJ1lmaN6qbvNqKlmp5Ziwba%2Fyp6enp1dlrazucSnZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
