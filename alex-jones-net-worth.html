It’s the planetary domination of London, New York, and Washington over the rest of the world. It’s hard to get people to join that or think they have a part in it if you called it the Anglo-American world empire.&nbsp;“Well, there’s something there for us too.” But that’s not what it is;&nbsp;it’s the Anglo-American New World Order.”&nbsp;</p><p>“If humanity has any hope of effecting real change for the better, it will not come from the Madison Avenue false reality makers who’ve cast&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Barack Obama</a>&nbsp;as the savior of the world. To alter our course from tyranny to liberty, to defeat the corrupt elite, we must get past the puppets and confront the real power structure of the planet.”&nbsp;</p><p>“&nbsp;Twenty years ago, it would not be expected that the New York Times would explain itself.
