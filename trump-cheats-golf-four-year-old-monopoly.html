You need strength and stamina to WIN, and I have strength and stamina — most others don’t. You also need strength and stamina to GOVERN!”</p><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>As the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Palm Beach Post</a> points out, however, Trump was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">attending the funeral of Lynette “Diamond” Hardaway</a> in North Carolina when the tournament kicked off on Saturday. When club members were supposedly “surprised” to see Trump enjoying a five-point by the second day, organizers were told that he had retroactively decided a strong round on Thursday, two days before the tournament started, would count as his Saturday score.</p><p data-characters=25 data-current-count=25 data-injectable=false>Nothing fishy about that!</p><p data-characters=172 data-current-count=197 data-injectable=false>The irony was apparently too much for Reilly, author the 2019 book Commander in Cheat: How Golf Explains Trump, who subsequently called out the 76-year-old alleged cheater.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>“How could Trump ‘win’ a two-day championship at his course in Florida this weekend when he spent most of Saturday at a funeral in North Carolina?” Reilly tweeted on Monday. “Same way he’s won all of his tourneys.

People say, Okay, so he cheats at golf. Well, yeah, but it goes deeper. If you’re going to cheat at golf, you’re probably going to cheat at business. And if you cheat at golf, you’re probably going to cheat on your wife. And if you cheat at golf, you’re probably going to cheat on your taxes.
