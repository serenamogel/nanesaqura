last year are furious over the company’s requirement that they return to the office at least three days per week, according to a report.</p><p>Farmers Group CEO Raul Vargas, who recently took over the California-based company, reversed his predecessor’s policy of allowing most employees to work from home.</p><p>Vargas’ about-face on remote workers sparked a deluge of angry responses from Farmers employees, who took to the firm’s internal social media platform and posted messages filled with angry and crying emojis, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Wall Street Journal.</a></p><p>“I sold my house and moved closer to my grandkids,” one employee in the claims division wrote on the message board.</p><p>“So sad that I made a huge financial decision based on a lie.”</p><p>The Journal cited another employee in the medical claims division who wrote: “I was hired as a remote worker and was promised that was the company culture moving forward.”</p><figure

Images</span></figure><p>“This is seemingly a power move that is frankly disgusting,” the employee wrote.</p><p>A Farmers spokesperson told The Post: “Emerging from the pandemic, the Farmers leadership team has decided the organization will move to a hybrid work environment beginning in September — a blended approach we believe will allow us to continue offering the flexibility that we all value while reaping the benefits of the office environment.”</p><p>The spokesperson said that “employees within a 50-mile radius of a Farmers office will work from their respective office location at least three days per week while having the flexibility to work remotely two days per week.”</p><p>“Based on business need and different types of positions, roughly 60 percent of Farmers employees will be hybrid, while other roles will be either virtual or in-office,” the spokesperson said.</p><p>“As business conditions — such as emerging from the pandemic — change, so must business approaches,” the company spokesperson said.</p><p>“We are regularly evaluating and adapting our ways of working to align with business needs.”</p><p>“To that end, the decision to embrace virtual work at the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020 was one that made sense at the time, and adopting a hybrid approach in September 2023 is what makes sense for our organization now,” the company said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Farmers Group CEO Raul Vargas recently reversed the company’s policy that allowed most employees to work from home.</figure><p>“While many employees are excited about the opportunities ahead, we recognize that not all business decisions will be supported by all employees.”</p><p>“However, we have approached this with a great deal of thoughtfulness, including giving employees three months advance notice so they have time to adjust and make arrangements.”</p><p>In internal communications with staffers, Vargas said the decision to bring employees back into the office would boost “collaboration, creativity, and innovation,” according to the Journal.</p><p>The CEO said the firm would have “the opportunity to combine the best of both worlds — all that we’ve gained from flexible and virtual work with all the teamwork and collaboration we get when we work together in the office.”</p><p>Former CEO Jeff Dailey had told employees last year that most of them would be allowed to remain virtual.</p><p>Employees told the Journal that the company had said it would either lease out or sell some of its office space in various locations, including Michigan, Kansas, Oklahoma and Arizona.</p><p>Last week, <a href=#>employees at Seattle-based e-commerce giant Amazon</a> walked off the job in protest of management’s edict to return to the office, among other complaints.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Farmers employees were furious over the decision to

back</a> against management’s directive that they report to the office four days per week.</p><p>Meta, Salesforce, <a href=#>JPMorgan Chase</a>, Apple, Citigroup, Google, and Goldman Sachs are among the blue-chip firms that have either partially or wholly done away with hybrid work.</p><p class=postsid
