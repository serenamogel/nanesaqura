The plants themselves—which lead scientist Alice (a chilling <a href=#>Emily Beecham</a>) affectionately names Little Joe after her own human boy (<a href=#>Kit Connor</a>)—are an explosion of crimson, with soft tendrils that seem to dance as their buds open. It’s as if they’re shyly saying hello—or subtly trying to enslave you.</p><p>In theory, Alice and her team intend for these to be “mood-lifting, anti-depressant happy plants.” And maybe there’s some sort of message here about the dangers of seeking shortcuts to wellbeing, rather than actually doing the work. Alice, an emotionally detached single mom, is herself in therapy as we see from a few of her sessions. Working with cinematographer <a href=#>Martin Gschlacht</a>, Hausner slowly and hypnotically moves the camera back and forth during long takes between Alice and her therapist (<a href=#>Lindsay Duncan</a>). The conversation, however, seems to go nowhere—although maybe that’s also the point.</p><p>What’s happening right under Alice’s nose (if you’ll pardon the pun), is that the plant she’s developed emits a pollen that initially elicits a sneeze, followed by total devotion. The people inhaling it don’t behave all that differently—but they also don’t seem overwhelmingly happy, either. Rather, they seem weirdly flat, like placid zombies—an indictment, perhaps, of a reliance on pharmaceuticals to even out emotional highs and lows.</p><p>There’s an eeriness at first to the human interactions that result from exposure to Little Joe—an awkwardness in the inability to connect comfortably. This is especially evident when Alice’s colleague Chris (<a href=#>Ben Whishaw</a>, playing against nice-guy type) tries to woo her, first with nervous invitations to after-work drinks, then with tentative attempts at kisses. The plant’s effects on another scientist’s emotional support dog—normally a sweet-tempered, playful creature—also create an underlying tension. But then the Japanese-inspired score—heavy on strings and drums, mixed with the surreal sound of dogs barking—provides an even more obvious jolt. It’s another bold stylistic choice, one that’s initially startling but eventually overbearing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46loK2snJp6q7vEZqSorpmaerOx1aKcsGViZX56</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
