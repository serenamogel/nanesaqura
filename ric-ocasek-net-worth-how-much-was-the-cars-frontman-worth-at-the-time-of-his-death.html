The Cars were formed in Boston in 1976 by Ocasek, Benjamin Orr (bass and vocals), Elliot Easton (guitar), Greg Hawkes (keyboards), and David Robinson (drums).

The album was a critical and commercial success, selling over six million copies in the US and earning them a nomination for Best New Artist at the Grammy Awards</p><p>The band followed up with five more studio albums: Candy-O (1979), Panorama (1980), Shake It Up (1981), Heartbeat City (1984), and Door to Door (1987).
