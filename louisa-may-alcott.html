Her novel Little Women gave Alcott financial independence and a lifetime writing career. She died in 1888.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Alcott was born on November 29, 1832, in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Alcott was a best-selling novelist of the late 1800s, and many of her works, most notably Little Women, remain popular today.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Alcott was taught by her father, Amos Bronson Alcott, until 1848, and studied informally with family friends such as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/henry-david-thoreau data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Henry David Thoreau" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Henry David Thoreau</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/ralph-waldo-emerson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ralph Waldo Emerson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> and Theodore Parker. Residing in Boston and Concord, Massachusetts, Alcott worked as a domestic servant and teacher, among other positions, to help support her family from 1850 to 1862. During the Civil War, she went to Washington, D.C. to work as a nurse.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Acclaimed Author: 'Little Women'</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Unknown to most people, Alcott had been publishing poems, short stories, thrillers and juvenile tales since 1851, under the pen name Flora Fairfield. In 1862, she also adopted the pen name A.M. Barnard, and some of her melodramas were produced on Boston stages. But it was her account of her Civil War experiences, Hospital Sketches (1863), that confirmed Alcott's desire to be a serious writer. She began to publish stories under her real name in Atlantic Monthly and Lady's Companion, and took a brief trip to Europe in 1865 before becoming editor of a girls' magazine, Merry's Museum.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The great success of Little Women gave Alcott financial independence and created a demand for more books. Over the final years of her life, she turned out a steady stream of novels and short stories, mostly for young people and drawn directly from her family life. Her other books include Little Men (1871), Eight Cousins (1875) and Jo's Boys (1886). Alcott also tried her hand at adult novels, such as Work (1873) and A Modern Mephistopheles (1877), but these tales were not as popular as her other writings.</p><ul data-node-id=14 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Louisa May Alcott</li><li>Birth Year: 1832</li><li>Birth date: November 29, 1832</li><li>Birth State: Pennsylvania</li><li>Birth City: Germantown</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Female</li><li>Best Known For: Louisa May Alcott was an American author who wrote the classic novel 'Little Women,' as well as various works under pseudonyms.</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Fiction and Poetry</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Sagittarius</li><li>Death Year: 1888</li><li>Death date: March 6, 1888</li><li>Death State: Massachusetts</li><li>Death City: Boston</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=17><ul data-node-id=19 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Louisa May Alcott Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/louisa-may-alcott</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: April 19, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><ul data-node-id=22 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Far away there in the sunshine are my highest aspirations.
