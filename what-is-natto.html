These days, Westerners don’t bat an eye at these foods. But there are some soybean products out there that may give some of us pause. One of these foods: natto. What is natto? We’ve got all the sticky, stringy intel here.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What is natto?</h3><p>Natto is a traditional Japanese food made from fermented soybeans. It’s not uncommon to ferment soybeans; <a href=#>miso paste</a> is a frequently used, fermented soybean product that appears in tons of Japanese foods. Natto, however, tends to wear its fermentation on its sleeve.</p><p>The origins of natto date all the way back to ancient Japan and is thought to be influenced by a similar Chinese food called douchi, made from fermented black soybeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What is natto made of?</h3><p>After soybeans are steamed to soften them up, they are given a healthy dose of Bacillus subtilis, a bacteria that kicks off the fermentation process. Kept in a high temperature for about a day, the bacteria gets to work on the beans. One of the byproducts of this process is the creation of a polyglutamic acid, a sticky, stringy film. Ultimately, this makes natto look like baked beans covered in slime.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What does natto taste like?</h3><p>Confession: I’ve never tried natto. I have had miso and other fermented foods like <a href=#>kimchi</a> and <a href=#>sauerkraut</a>. And one thing I can say for sure is that fermented foods are not bringing neutral flavors to the table.</p><p>The internet seems split on the taste of natto. Some call it a mild bitterness, others say it’s a bit cheesy, like <a href=#>cottage cheese</a>. One source who recently tasted natto for the first time described it as initially nutty followed by a sharp funk—almost like extremely ripe blue cheese. One thing everyone can agree on: Natto is unique. But it’s the smell that really turns people off.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What does natto smell like?</h3><p>Pungent. Funky. Old. Stinky. Putrid. Ammonia-like. These are just a few descriptors people have used to describe natto’s smell. Some compared it to week-old socks, soured <a href=#>Brie cheese</a>, or a bucket of mop water. It seems that natto rivals the durian fruit in the stink department.</p><p>The taste, the smell, and the slimy texture all combine to make natto a very controversial, polarizing food, one that I am now dying to try. It feels like it would be a badge of honor.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How do you eat natto?</h3><p>In Japan, natto is traditionally a breakfast food, served cold over a pile of white rice. It is sometimes served as an accoutrement to sushi, salad, and noodle dishes.</p><p>Often, the natto flavor is enhanced—or masked—with a dash of soy sauce, karashi mustard, and onion. These inclusions might be a good choice for natto beginners like myself.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Is natto vegan?</h3><p>Vegans, pull up a seat. Natto is fully vegan. Just make sure to wear a bib so you don’t get slime on your shirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmpZqspKR8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
