"She's got great hair, she always has done. I can tell by the ends of her hair that they're not extensions. They have a softness to them and they're split in places. I think her new curtain bangs and addition of layers has made the back look longer, that's all."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fdc3b13d82f5-kate-middleton-wedding-hair.jpg><p id=ebhUi2f6Ff data-wc=27>As our conversation meanders between hair extensions and royal hair looks, Chris shares his vision for Princess Kate if she were to sit in his styling chair.</p><p id=evt4EJJXSKrD data-wc=22>Kate's trailblazing 'Demi Chignon' wedding hair broke a 350-year royal tradition of bridal updos, with cascading curls falling behind her tulle veil.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: 100 years of royal hairstyles</figure><p id=eosTK0IDFE data-wc=53>"If Kate was getting married today, I'd modernise that look with a centre parting.

The curls looked quite set too, I'd brush them out to give them a bit more fluidity."&nbsp;</p><p id=eOwT33f99N data-wc=47>After getting his first job in a salon at just 13, Chris went on to win Young Hairdresser of the Year at 27, kickstarting his illustrious career with some of the industry's biggest names; Kate Moss, Ariana Grande, Adele and Dua Lipa, to name just a few.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLg1S5pMh4 data-wc=22>Before we close our chat, I ask Chris if he could pinpoint a career-defining moment in his 27-year experience working with hair.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3e2519767da8-2974250161126925481981911843655607821043392n.jpg><p id=eBSRBXyl9w data-wc=60>"Moving to America," he says. "A lot changed for me when I moved seven years ago. I took a leap of faith to see if I could go to Hollywood. I'm just a guy from Leicester and didn't really believe that I could ever do that, so the fact that I've managed to is something I feel so proud of."&nbsp;</p><p id=euwtiwgPQw8 data-wc=21>And as for hair trends that Chris thinks should stay in 2023?
