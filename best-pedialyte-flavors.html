That or you’re planning on not feeling well in the very near future because you’re about to go on a bender (look at you planning ahead!). Either way, the flavor of what you’re about to slam to hydrate in a hurry might seem incidental. But I’d argue that flavor is super important! If you’re sick, the last thing you want to is take a big ol’ swig of something that turns your stomach.</p><p>That’s where we come in! We tasted every flavor of Pedialyte we could get our hands on to find the best. This is still an electrolyte solution so prepare your palate for that signature saltiness, but these are the flavors we think you should sip the next time you’re in need.</p><p class=has-small-font-size>The following article contains affiliate links that may generate a small commission to us when you make a purchase through the link.

In general, we thought these Advanced Care options (which include zinc, selenium, and prebiotics, fwiw) had a milder flavor than regular Pedialyte, which helped them to seem a little less like watered-down medicine. They also seemed to be a little less salty tasting. This particular Pedialyte has a nice mango-ey flavor and we unanimously decided it was the best we tasted.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>9/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pedialyte flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BEST_PEDIALYTE_FLAVORS_INSET_02.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Surprise</p><strong>Pedialyte Coconut Burst</strong><p>Is it just me or does coconut Pedialyte sound like it would be sort of gross? While I’ll admit this might not be the best choice if you’re recovering from a night of too many frozen Piña Coladas, this flavor was a lot better than any of us expected it would be. “This tastes like a nice coconut water with a little bit of salinity to it,” Danny said. If you’re accustomed to turning to coconut water for quick hydration, this is a surprisingly natural pick.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pedialyte flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BEST_PEDIALYTE_FLAVORS_INSET_03.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Berry</p><strong>Advanced Care with Immune Support Blue Raspberry</strong><p>Like the other Advanced Care options we tasted, this Blue Raspberry variety came off as a little less salty and a little less cloying than traditional Pedialyte, and we liked that. Sure, the artificial blue hue may be a little off-putting, but the flavor is nice and tart and pleasant. Staff writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> compared it to a melted popsicle. If that’s not refreshing when you feel like you’re quietly dying, I’m not sure what is.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>8.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pedialyte flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BEST_PEDIALYTE_FLAVORS_INSET_04.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Zero Sugar</p><strong>Pedialyte Zero Sugar Berry Frost</strong><p>Presumably by virtue of having no sugar, this one has a super mild flavor everyone appreciated. If you shy away from artificial dyes, this is a good option too. It’s sweetened with sucralose rather than sugar, which may turn some people off, but that takes the calorie count down to just 5 in a 12-ounce serving. If you’re watching sugar intake, this Berry Frost flavor is tart and pleasant and actually melds nicely with the salinity of the beverage overall.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pedialyte flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BEST_PEDIALYTE_FLAVORS_INSET_05.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best Tangy Flavor</p><strong>Pedialyte Strawberry Lemonade</strong><p>I truly believe in the power of persuasion, and there’s something about strawberry lemonade-flavored things that just feels super refreshing. Lemon doesn’t make much of an appearance here, but this flavor still has a nice, nostalgic tang that reminded me of some combination of melted fruit snacks, powdered Country Time, and the Strawberry Lemonade Lip Smackers everyone wore in the 1990s. Overall, a solid choice if you’re ailing!</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7.5/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><span aria-hidden=true class="wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim"></span><img decoding=async width=612 height=696 alt="best pedialyte flavors" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/sporked.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/BEST_PEDIALYTE_FLAVORS_INSET_06.gif data-object-fit=cover style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="has-text-align-center has-large-font-size">Best in a Pinch</p><strong>Pedialyte Mixed Fruit</strong><p>I don’t know about you, but whenever I wind up seeking out a bottle of Pedialyte at Target or my local CVS, this is always the flavor I find. I can’t say for sure it’s the most prevalent flavor, but it sure seems that way, right? Anyway, if you’re looking for one of the other, better flavors on this list and just can’t find it, Mixed Fruit Pedialyte is mostly inoffensive and will truly work in a pinch. A little bit of salty fruit punch never hurt anyone and neither will this.</p><p class="has-grey-color has-text-color has-small-font-size">Credit: Merc / Walmart</p><p class=rating>Rating:</p><p class=score>7/10</p><p class=sporks-title>Sporks</p><p><strong>Other products we tried:</strong> Pedialyte Organic Grape, Pedialyte Sport Lemon-Lime, Pedialyte Sport Fruit Punch, Pedialyte AdvancedCare Plus Chilled Cherry Pomegranate, Pedialyte AdvancedCare Cherry Punch, Pedialyte Grape, Pedialyte Unflavored</p><p class="has-light-purple-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size"><strong>Film your own taste test at home and share with us using #SporkedTasteTest for a chance to be featured on our social pages!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFuvMSdoJqkqamybrLLmq2oqqNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
