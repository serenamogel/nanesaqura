They’re very private. It was a teenage romance, but sadly it just didn’t work out,” the source said.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/UyRw7-VYZ-P8IGZwPRKqWX0ppOM=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/YLL7USC7KVDKTEFH7JO6EUKFLE.jpg"><p>The young couple first started dating in May 2022 after reportedly meeting earlier that year, at the time a source told <i>The Sun</i> that the young Beckham son was “smitten” and that Holding was “not fazed by Cruz’s fame and where he comes from”.</p><p>Cruz has previously dated Bliss Chapman, with the relationship lasting approximately 18 months, however the <i>Daily Mail</i> reported they parted ways in March 2022 shortly before he began dating Holding.</p><p>It comes after Cruz joined his family on the carpet for his father’s documentary premiere and turned heads with his resemblance to his father. Donning a longer hairstyle, the aspiring singer and musician was the spitting image of David before the former footballer made his money move to Real Madrid in 2003.</p><p>The <a href=#><i>Beckham</i> documentary</a> has included many details about David and Victoria’s relationship and even addressed the infidelity claims that plagued the couple after the former footballer’s move to Spain wit Real Madrid in the early 2000s.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>David was spotted leaving a nightclub with his now-former personal assistant Rebecca Loos in 2003 and, shortly after, she spoke to the now-defunct <i>News of the World</i> outlet claiming the pair had an extramarital affair. Loos claimed it took place over four months when she was assigned to look after David following his transfer from Manchester United.</p><p>The former football star called the claims “ludicrous” at the time, now the couple has spoken freely about the alleged affair with <a href=#>Victoria admitting it was the “hardest” period of her marriage</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSws8HZZpmem5udrq55wKebZp%2BZp7mnvsiepZ1lpJa7onnHqKOdoZ6cwG6%2Fz6WgrWWimsOmrcuem2aZlqmys3nAm6qeppOaeqe%2BzqZkp52km7mqxIydppynXaW%2FprnInqmeZ2aMpJqcpY2IjIpxiKWCjaB8iI16gXqai5%2B4aA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
