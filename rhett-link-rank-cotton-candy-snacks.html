And yes, I am an adult who has a real job. I can’t really explain it, but the gist is that when I see it, I must have it, especially if it’s blue. Maybe I’m broken and my tastebuds never hit puberty, but, hey, they’re doing their best. Speaking of buds doing their best, Rhett & Link tried six different cotton candy snacks on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">an October 2020 episode of Good Mythical Morning</a> to determine which would taste the most like cotton candy and earn the coveted title of Cotton Candy Brian.

Link said, “Oh, It’s bad.” However, Rhett decided the cotton candy flavor in this Faygo soda is, in fact, “really, really good.” In the end, it beat out the cotton candy grapes, which Rhett called an “incredible feat of culinary craziness,” so that’s something.</p><strong>Cotton Candy Grapes&nbsp;</strong><p>Would it really be a list of cotton candy snacks if we didn’t mention cotton candy grapes? Naurr (as they say in Australia). Side note, I love these, and I, for one, think they taste almost exactly like cotton candy. Did the guys agree? The answer is a resounding “eh.” Rhett was blown away by them, calling them “more cotton candy-y than anything we’ve tasted so far.” Link, on the other hand, only got “a lot of grape” from the flavor of these bad boys. Rhett then was feeling a little gaslit (and so was I, to be honest), so he asked Mythical Chef Josh for a third opinion and Josh thought they tasted like cotton candy “big time.” So, in conclusion, these grapes do taste like cotton candy.&nbsp;</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Baskin Robbins Cotton Candy Ice Cream</a></strong><p>This one tied for second with the grapes. There’s a very specific cotton candy taste in this ice cream that, according to Rhett, “only shows up in the tail end” of the flavor. That is to say, the cotton candy flavor is more of an aftertaste than a predominant flavor. But it’s an accurate aftertaste. So for that reason, Rhett and Link ranked it pretty high up.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pop Rocks Cotton Candy Explosion</a></strong><p>As Link said, “Wow, they added the word explosion!” I agree, it’s aggressive. As for how these actually taste, the answer is “a little bit of pain.” According to R&L, it was “good pain” though. This one had them questioning if cotton candy tastes like anything at all or if it’s just the colors that evoke the cotton candyness. But, nonetheless, they gave this one a solid middle-of-the-road score.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MainStreet Cotton Candy Popcorn</a></strong><p>This popcorn tied with the Pop Rocks and had beautiful vibrant pink and blue colors. Link had just finished explaining how cotton candy flavor is an illusion when he tried this popcorn and immediately said, “Oh wow, it’s pretty cotton candy-y.” Rhett, on the other hand, didn’t think this popcorn tasted like much at all, but had more of an icing or cake flavor to it.</p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cotton Candy Crunch Cap’n Crunch</a></strong><p>This is pink-and-blue Cap’n Crunch that tastes like, well, Cap’n Crunch. Rhett said if he were to eat it with his eyes closed, he wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between this and the classic Cap’n Crunch. Link thought there might be the slightest cotton candy aftertaste, but overall this one didn’t taste much like cotton candy at all.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><a href=# class="lazy-load-youtube preview-lazyload preview-youtube" data-video-title="What's The Best Cotton Candy Snack?
