The Game Boy Color enhancement of Pokémon Yellow mimics these restrictions throughout the majority of the game, despite being capable of assigning different color palettes (regardless of overlapping). These introduction scenes are the only known portion of the game to disobey this "overlapping" restriction.</p><h5><span class=mw-headline id=Glitches>Glitches</span></h5><p>When run on a Super Game Boy, the international versions of Pokémon Yellow feature a bizarre graphical glitch when the introduction loops more than once.</p><p>Normally, color palette 16 (0x10) is intended for introduction scenes of Pikachu against a white background. Instead, the color palette information from the previous title screen is not correctly overwritten—which results in half of color palette 14 (0x0E) and half of color palette 16 displaying the screen. The color palettes are then changed at a later part in the introduction, such that color palette 16 and color palette 0 (0x00) are displaying the screen. Once the title screen is reached a second time, the "Pokémon" logo is displayed in color palette 16, with Pikachu displayed in color palette 0. Repeating the introduction again does not result in any further color palette changes - correct, or incorrect.</p><ul><li>Introduction scenes of Pikachu against a blue background (using color palette 37) are not affected by this graphical glitch.</li><li>This graphical glitch is not present when the international version of Pokémon Yellow is run on a Game Boy Color.</li><li>This graphical glitch is also not present when the japanese version of Pokémon Yellow is run on a Super Game Boy.</li></ul><h3><span class=mw-headline id=Generation_II><a href=# title="Generation II">Generation II</a></span></h3><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_Gold_and_Silver></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_Gold_and_Silver>Pokémon Gold and Silver</span></h4><p>In <a href=# title="Pokémon Gold and Silver Versions">Pokémon Gold and Silver</a>, the game intro starts with a star quickly moving in a spiral, which turns into the <a href=# title="Game Freak">Game Freak</a> logo.</p><p>Then, three <a href=# title="Shellder (Pokémon)">Shellder</a> appear underwater.
