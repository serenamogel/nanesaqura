After Gotterba claimed he had an affair with the actor in the 1980s and planned to write a tell-all about it, Travolta attempted to block him from doing so with a cease and desist letter, citing an employment confidentiality agreement, per the<a href=#>&nbsp;New York Daily News</a>. Despite a judge's response in Gotterba's favor, the book has yet to come to fruition.</p><p>In 2017, Travolta told the<a href=#>&nbsp;Daily Beast</a> that rumors and tell-all threats are "every celebrity's Achilles heel." "It's just about people wanting money. That's all. It happens on many levels," he said. The actor explained that he chose to ignore rumors about his sexuality because he couldn't control what was written in the tabloids, but he added that he drew the line when it came to dragging his family into the gossip.&nbsp;</p><p>"I found it most offensive with the loss of my son," Travolta said. "I felt like that was the lowest I'd ever felt. Sex stuff is always going to be interesting to somebody, but you stay away from family. You really should. With that, I always felt like the media — not all of the media, but parts of it — went too low there."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamxiZYZ4hY6erZ6qqam1qrrGZqGooJ5iwbOt1aijrZldqK6qsIyamaitpGK1qr%2BMrJyxrZGhtrXFjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
