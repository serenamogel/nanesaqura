The relatively new holiday is a celebration of the mathematical calculation pi, or the infinite number representing the constant ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter. Pi is essential to engineering and modern construction.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although many sought to find it, the calculation of pi, which is also expressed by the fraction 22/7, is commonly credited to Greek mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse more than 2,200 years ago.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/news/where-did-pi-day-come-from data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to History.com" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to History.com</a>, physicist Larry Shaw founded Pi Day day in 1988, selecting March 14 because the numeric date represents the first three digits of pi (3.14). It also happens to be <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scientists/albert-einstein data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Albert Einstein" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Albert Einstein</a>’s birthday.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The first Pi Day took place at the Exploratorium, a San Francisco–based science museum, and featured a circular parade and fruit pies. The latter has become a delicious tradition among academic and office settings. In 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/news/where-did-pi-day-come-from data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="passed a resolution" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">passed a resolution</a> recognizing March 14 as National Pi Day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.exploratorium.edu/pi/history-of-pi data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to the Exploratorium" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to the Exploratorium</a>, mathematicians began using π, the Greek letter pi, for the calculation’s symbol in the 1700s, starting with William Jones in 1706. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/scientist/leonhard-euler data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Leonhard Euler" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Leonhard Euler</a> subsequently popularized the symbol.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As for Archimedes, you might be surprised to learn that pi was just one of his many important discoveries and inventions.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Who Was Archimedes?</h2><img alt="drawing of roman soldier confronting mathematician archimedes" title="Roman soldier killing greek mathematician Archimedes" width=1881 height=1599 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/roman-soldier-killing-greek-mathematician-royalty-free-illustration-1678294759.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>In this drawing, Archimedes is confronted by a Roman soldier during the takeover of Syracuse.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/archimedes/lrk_biography.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to NOVA" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to NOVA</a>, Archimedes was born in Syracuse—on the Mediterranean island of Sicily, not upstate New York—around 287 BCE. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.math.tamu.edu/~don.allen/history/archimed/archimed.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="He was" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">He was</a> the son of astronomer Phidias and a close ally of Syracuse’s King Hieron and his son, whom he served many years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Archimedes <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/archimedes/lrk_biography.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="traveled to Egypt" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">traveled to Egypt</a> to study at the Library of Alexandria at age 18 and, upon completing his work, returned to Syracuse around 263 BCE for the remainder of his life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Over roughly the next 50 years, Archimedes developed most of his major theories. These included the fundamental principles of mechanics; methods for finding the center of gravity, surface area, and volume of geometric figures; the principle of buoyancy; and, of course, an estimate for the value of pi.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Archimedes was obsessed with math, often getting lost in his work and forgetting to eat. Legend has it he discovered his principle of buoyancy while taking a bath. Excited, he leapt out of the tub and ran naked through the streets of Syracuse shouting, “Eureka!”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.math.tamu.edu/~don.allen/history/archimed/archimed.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="By one account" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">By one account</a>, Greek philosopher Plutarch reported that Archimedes died while solving a math problem. In 212 BCE, during the Second Punic War, a Roman solider asked Archimedes to accompany him amid a siege of Syracuse. Archimedes refused, and the angry soldier stabbed him with a sword.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More Famous Mathematicians</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=16 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">What Else Did Archimedes Do?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Archimedes is often <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/archimedes/lrk_biography.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="credited with inventing" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">credited with inventing</a> the Archimedes’ screw, a device for raising water, while in Egypt. The large helix is encased lengthwise in a watertight covering with openings at both ends. When one end is placed in water and the device is elevated at an angle and turned, water trapped in air pockets rises from the lower end through the open upper end.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Back then, it was used to pump water out of ships and for irrigation. But the design is still used today. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lift-water-with-an-archimedes-screw/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to Scientific American" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to Scientific American</a>, modern examples include lifting wastewater in treatment plants and even lifting water for some amusement park rides.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Archimedes also created a means for approximating square roots and devised ways of calculating area and volume two millennia before the invention of calculus.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When the Romans invaded Syracuse, Archimedes’ “engines of war” helped defend the city. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/archimedes/lrk_biography.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="These devices included" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">These devices included</a> cranes to drop rocks, claws to lift ships from the water, and machines to fire wooden missiles. He also devised a set of mirrors that focused sunlight on enemy ships, setting them on fire.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Finally, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/archimedes/lrk_biography.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Archimedes proved" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Archimedes proved</a> the volume of a sphere is two-thirds the volume of a circumscribed cylinder. He considered this his greatest accomplishment and asked that a representation of a sphere inside a cylinder be left on his tomb. He is likely buried in Sicily.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Tracing Archimedes’ Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/archimedes/lrk_biography.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="According to NOVA" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">According to NOVA</a>, scribes copied Archimedes’ writings onto parchment in 300 AD. His manuscript explaining how he developed his mathematical theorems was copied and bound onto vellum sheets around 1000.

Finished in 1229 and likely made in Jerusalem, this manuscript became known as the Archimedes Palimpsest. It is the only surviving copy of Archimedes’ manuscript and contains several of his treatises.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For about 400 years, the Palimpsest was stored in a monastery in the Judean desert before being moved to a library in Old Jerusalem. German scholar Constantine Tischendorf discovered it in Constantinople in 1846, and Danish scholar Johan Ludwig attempted to transcribe it in 1906 using a magnifying glass.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Shockingly, the Palimpsest <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/archimedes/lrk_biography.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=disappeared class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">disappeared</a> for much of the 20th century.
