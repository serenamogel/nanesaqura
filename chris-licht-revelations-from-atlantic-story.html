Alberta spoke with almost 100 CNN employees for the piece, which portrayed Licht in such a negative light that even the network described it as the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/07/media/chris-licht-cnn/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“final death knell”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">“final death knell”</a> before Licht’s dismissal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The soon-to-be ousted executive apologized after the article was released, saying he didn’t recognize the person it portrayed and vowing to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/05/media/cnn-chris-licht-reliable-sources/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="“fight like hell”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">“fight like hell”</a> to win back the trust of his CNN colleagues. But it was too late. Five days after the article published, Licht was out of a job.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Below are five of the most damaging revelations from the piece.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">A Disastrous Trump Town Hall</h2><img alt="donald trump, wearing a black suit and red tie, standing at a podium and speaking to a crowd from a microphone, while standing in front of several flags" title="Former President Trump campaigns in Iowa in June 2023" width=6000 height=4000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/former-president-donald-trump-greets-supporters-at-a-team-news-photo-1686165018.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Donald Trump speaks during a June 2023 campaign event in Grimes, Iowa. The former president who is running for reelection was featured in a CNN town hall in May.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">More than any other specific instance from Licht’s tenure, The Atlantic article focuses on the televised town hall with Donald Trump on May 10. Hosted by Kaitlan Collins, the 70-minute event saw Trump unleash “a continuous blast of distortion, hyperbole, and lies” before an audience of Trump supporters “cheering him on so loudly and so purposefully that what began as a journalistic forum devolved into a WWE match,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/cnn-ratings-chris-licht-trump/674255/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alberta wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alberta wrote</a>.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The article portrays Licht as both unprepared and unconcerned with how CNN would cover Trump, who had repeatedly barraged the network as “fake news” and “the enemy of the people” throughout his presidency. When asked about future coverage of Trump before the town hall, Licht said, “The media has absolutely, I believe, learned its lesson… We know that we’re getting played, so we’re gonna resist it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Licht believed Trump’s political ascent stemmed, in part, from the media marginalizing conservative views, and he sought to prioritize winning new Republican viewers for CNN, according to The Atlantic. Rather than a neutral audience for the town hall, Licht pushed for the crowd to be “extra Trumpy” because he felt it represented the GOP base. Licht even told Trump to “have fun” before the town hall, according to Alberta.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Licht believed the prime-time town hall with Trump would vindicate his courting of Republican viewers and prove to his colleagues that his vision would lead the network into the future, according to The Atlantic. But as its story said, “Trump had other ideas.”</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">His Obsession with Former CEO Jeff Zucker</h2><img alt="jeff zucker and chris licht, both wearing suits, smile for the camera while standing in front of an orange wall" title="Jeff Zucker and Chris Licht in June 2019" width=2458 height=3686 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/president-cnn-worldwide-jeff-zucker-and-late-show-news-photo-1686165085.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Jeff Zucker and Chris Licht attend a June 2019 event in New York City.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A recurring theme throughout The Atlantic piece is Licht’s apparent fixation on his predecessor, Jeff Zucker, who oversaw CNN for nine years before <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/media/jeff-zucker-cnn/index.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="resigning in February 2022" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">resigning in February 2022</a> amid a sex scandal. “The comparisons with Zucker were inevitable, and Licht hated them,” Alberta <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/cnn-ratings-chris-licht-trump/674255/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="wrote in the article" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">wrote in the article</a>. One of Licht’s first acts as CEO was to turn Zucker’s former 17th floor office into a conference room.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Licht became “consumed by” the growing negative stories in the media about his leadership with CNN, and soon, he began blaming Zucker for the bad publicity, according to The Atlantic. Licht believed pro-Zucker colleagues were leaking information to reporters and became convinced even Zucker was pushing hit pieces scrutinizing Licht’s job performance.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One widely-quoted portion of Alberta’s story described a 6 a.m. workout, in which Licht lifted weights while his trainer Joe Maysonet yells at him. While squatting to hoist a pole from the ground, Licht said through clenched teeth, “Zucker couldn’t do this s––.” It was unclear whether Licht meant the comment as a joke.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Awkward Behavior at a Holiday Party</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">One of the key distinctions between Zucker and Licht was their social interactions with colleagues. “Whereas the old boss was gregarious and warm, giving nicknames to employees and remembering their kids’ birthdays, Licht came across as taciturn, seemingly going out of his way to avoid human relationships,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/cnn-ratings-chris-licht-trump/674255/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alberta wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alberta wrote</a>.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">This difference was on prominent display during a holiday party for CNN’s Washington-based employees, according to the article. Licht began the party by walking around the private room and personally greeting each journalist. Afterward, however, he sat down and spent most of the rest of his dinner staring at his phone.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Not only did he say nothing to address the group—as they all expected he would—but Licht barely interacted with the people seated near him,” Alberta wrote. “It became so awkward that guests began texting one another, wondering if there was some crisis unfolding with an international bureau.” When some of his colleagues caught a glimpse of Licht’s phone, however, they saw that he was simply reading a critical story about him on the news website Puck.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More from Biography.com</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Criticizing CNN’s COVID-19 Coverage</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Among the mistakes from Zucker’s tenure, according to Licht, was CNN’s coverage of COVID-19. The Atlantic article describes Licht as repeatedly—and publicly—criticizing his CNN colleagues for their reporting on the pandemic, saying it portrayed the network as out of touch with the country.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“In the beginning it was a trusted source—this crazy thing, no one understands it, help us make sense of it. What’s going on?” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/cnn-ratings-chris-licht-trump/674255/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Licht said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Licht said</a>. “And I think then it got to a place where, ‘Oh wow, we gotta keep getting those ratings. We gotta keep getting the sense of urgency.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">To illustrate his point, the story describes Licht as slapping his palm on a table and mimicking a panicked broadcaster: “‘COVID, COVID, COVID! Look at the case numbers! Look at this! Look at this!’… Then people walked outside, and they go, ‘This is not my life. This is not my reality. You guys are just saying this because you need the ratings, you need the clicks. I don’t trust you.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The story also quotes Licht as questioning the death count of COVID-19, suggesting it was overinflated by patients with life-threatening illnesses before the pandemic began who then died with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. There have been nearly 770 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and 6.9 million reported deaths, though some estimate it could be <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="as many as 30 million" data-vars-ga-product-id=b5475b31-a6dc-45ec-a2d5-12b5cea6548b data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates data-product-url=https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/coronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.economist.com%2Fgraphic-detail%2Fcoronavirus-excess-deaths-estimates" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$25.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=23e6565f-a7d7-4c98-8de0-67020d15f2b0 class="body-link product-links css-9lyfaf e1rq56bv0">as many as 30 million</a>.</p><h2 data-node-id=29 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">An Internal Meeting Gone Wrong</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Licht held a town hall meeting with employees intended to “quell concerns and rally the troops, laying out his plan for the new CNN,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/cnn-ratings-chris-licht-trump/674255/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alberta wrote" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Alberta wrote</a>. Audie Cornish, CNN’s top audio journalist, served as host and posed questions to Licht during the gathering, while dozens of staffers watched in person and thousands tuned in remotely on their computers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As the meeting progressed, however, Licht seemed to grow increasingly restless and impatient with the questions, according to The Atlantic article. Alberta wrote that Licht “looked on edge—like he was struggling to remain diplomatic in the face of questions that annoyed him.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">When asked about the perception that Licht was trying to appease right-wing viewers, Alberta wrote that Licht “fought a smirk.” In response to Cornish’s questions about CNN’s reputation and brand, Licht seemed defensive as he said that “sometimes the tone of our coverage has undercut the work of our journalism.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Afterward, Licht acknowledged to Alberta that the meeting had not gone well, according to the story: “At one point, I wanted to just say, ‘We’re not going to turn into BuzzFeed, okay?’” Licht said. “But that probably wouldn’t have helped.”</p><span class="css-1s9owpq e17dn9hs1"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/7b0fd6ec-180e-4db7-98aa-b972ecefdf97_1675802159.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Colin McEvoy" title="Headshot of Colin McEvoy" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Colin McEvoy joined the Biography.com staff in 2023, and before that had spent 16 years as a journalist, writer, and communications professional.
