The show revolves around the character of Andrea Greene, also known as Dre, who is accused of being a serial killer. But is Andrea Greene real? The answer is no. Andrea Greene is a completely fictional character created for the series. However, the show’s creators have drawn inspiration from real-life events to create the storyline of the show. The character of Dre is not based on any real person, and she is not a real-life serial killer. The show’s creators have gone to great lengths to ensure that viewers understand that the show is a work of fiction. Throughout the series, disclaimers appear on the screen to remind viewers that the events depicted in the show are not real. However, despite these disclaimers, some viewers may still believe that Andrea Greene is a real person.</p><p>One reason for this may be due to episode 6 of the series, which follows a detective investigating Dre’s murders. In this episode, Dre and her late “sister” Marissa are played by different actresses, creating the illusion that the characters are based on real people. However, this is not the case, and the show’s creators have confirmed that Dre is entirely fictional. Despite this, the show’s storyline is inspired by real-life events. Co-creator Janine Nabers revealed that the team spent months researching events that took place between 2016 and 2018 to create the show’s narrative. The team combined real internet rumors and real murders to create the events that Dre finds herself involved in throughout the series. In conclusion, Andrea Greene, also known as Dre, is not a real person. She is a fictional character created for the show Swarm, but her crimes are based on real-world events. While it’s easy to see why some viewers may believe that Dre is a real person, the show’s creators have made it clear that the events depicted in the show are not real.</p><h2 id=swarm_release_date_and_plot_preview class=smooth-goto>Swarm Release Date and Plot Preview</h2><p>‘Swarm’ premiered on Amazon Prime Video on March 17, 2023.
