This is not another April Fool, just a May Fact.&nbsp; Before signing as Bilbo, Martin had agreed to make three 90-minute TV films in London, again playing Dr Watson to Benedict Cumberbatch’s Sherlock Holmes.&nbsp; No worries: he’ll be back in Middle Earth after our first hiatus, during which Peter Jackson will have spare time to edit the scenes already completed.&nbsp; The rest of the cast remains on duty for another few weeks, working on hobbit-less sections of the film.&nbsp; These involve dwarves of course but also elves, with Hugo Weaving back for a stretch as Lord Elrond.”</p><p data-characters=425 data-current-count=425 data-injectable=true>The entry goes on to say that <strong>Sylvester McCoy</strong> will be playing Radagast the Brown and <strong>Bret McKenzie</strong> will be playing an elf named Lindir.&nbsp; As noted, <strong>Martin Freeman</strong> is only taking a break from <strong>The Hobbit</strong> and will return later.&nbsp; As for actors leaving the cast for good, <strong><a href=#>Saoirse Ronan</a></strong> officially stated that she will not be participating in the film. Ronan is just interested in other projects and their scheduling is a problem:</p><p>“It’s probably not going to work out with The Hobbit unfortunately. Because I would have been working for about a year on it and there were other projects that I was very interested in, but Pete and [his producer wife] Fran have been very good about it and very understanding.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXZ28o67IrWSfqp%2BjwW6%2FwKigq6uVYr%2BwusCnZKGtl6R6uLHAr6Cnn12owaLF0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
