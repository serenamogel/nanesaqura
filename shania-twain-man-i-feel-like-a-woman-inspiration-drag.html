I Feel Like a Woman!” is the ultimate girl power anthem. With lyrics like “No inhibitions, make no conditions / Get a little outta line / I ain’t gonna act politically correct / I only want to have a good time / The best thing about being a woman is the prerogative to have a little fun,” it’s all about letting loose for a no hold’s bar night on the town.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But the actual inspiration behind the song? Men at Toronto’s LGBTQ bars.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The singer co-wrote the song, featured on her 1997 album, Come On Over, with her producer-turned-ex-husband Robert John “Mutt” Lange. Twain has said the hit was likely inspired by nights out at gay clubs with her friends during her teen years. And it’s no wonder that today, it’s become as popular with drag queens as it has with audiences of every kind.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">Listen to “Man!

We’d dress like her, back-comb our hair until it was too big and all spiky, then head out on the town.”</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Behind the Lyrics</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For a small-town girl from Timmins, the experience was eye-opening. “This was an adventure for me, as it was all new,” she wrote. “Gay bars had the best dance music and the most impressive dancers... Being inexperienced at applying makeup, I marveled at how artistic and glamorous some of the men were. They looked so gorgeous, with features that had been defined and exaggerated with blushes, liners, shadows, and accessories.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Twain reflected on these nights out in August 2023 before a 25th anniversary edition of Come On Over released. “When I look back at those late teen [years], I was with all these guys, and I didn’t know if they were gay or if they were just dressing up on the weekend,” Twain <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://themessenger.com/entertainment/shania-twain-interview-man-i-feel-like-a-woman-gay-bars data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told The Messenger" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told The Messenger</a>. “There was no need to judge or even decide anything among ourselves—we were just being free-spirited about dressing and makeup and all these things.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Regardless of their identities, their aesthetic skill impressed her quite a bit. “My fascination with this initial introduction to men transforming themselves into beautiful women likely sowed the seed of inspiration for a song I would write years later: ‘Man! I Feel Like a Woman!’” she revealed in her book.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">A local gig opened her eyes to the world of performance and drag</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">As she was discovering new worlds and honing her craft, an unthinkable tragedy happened when Twain was 21. Her mother, Sharon, and stepfather, Jerry, were killed in a car accident.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I was just going to give up music,” Twain <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.nashcountrydaily.com/1995/03/07/hot-newcomer-shania-twain-revisits-canadian-resort-that-started-her-career/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Country Weekly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told Country Weekly</a> in 1995. “I thought, my family comes first. I have to take care of them. I didn’t even think of the future.” As fate would have it, taking care of her younger siblings—Carrie-Ann, Darryl, and Mark—came in the form of a performing job at Deerhurst Resort in Huntsville, Ontario. “I’m lucky I got the job at Deerhurst because it was music,” she continued.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Not only did the job keep her on track, but it also introduced her to the world of showmanship. “Deerhurst was the first time I was directed on stage, and it was the first time I had dancers. It educated me,” she <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.macleans.ca/culture/shania-twain-in-conversation-im-not-25-i-want-to-love-where-im-going-but-its-a-challenge/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told the Canadian publication Macleans" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">told the Canadian publication Macleans</a> in 2015.</p><img alt="shania twain walks across a stage while smiling and holding a microphone, she wears a sparkling body suit and knee high black heeled boots" title="Shania Twain performs in December 2012 at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace" width=3000 height=2058 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/singer-shania-twain-performs-during-the-debut-of-her-news-photo-1701799297.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Shania Twain during a December 2012 performance at The Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“When it was time to put together my show in Vegas, all that dazzle wasn’t foreign to me. I was familiar with the whole feel of a big stage show because of my being there,” she said of the resort. “It was like a mini-Vegas! Or like attending a Vegas performing arts school.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Some sources report that her exposure to drag performers during her time there also contributed to the influences of “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!”</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Twain believes the song brings people together</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Twain’s early influences from her Toronto club days and her Vegas-like training likely combined to bring the frivolous fun to “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!,” extending wide appeal to a broad swath of listeners. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/how-shania-twain-empowered-an-unlikely-group-of-female-artists-196024/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rolling Stone" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rolling Stone</a> even called the music video, in which Twain dresses up in a menswear-inspired look, complete with a top hat, “stereotypically male and indulgently female.” And, like in her early gay club days, the men in the video don perfect eyeliner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“A lot of straight men sing ‘Man! I Feel Like a Woman!’ just for the sheer entertainment of it,” she said in a 2017 <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://pridesource.com/article/83336-2/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="interview with PrideSource" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">interview with PrideSource</a>. “I think songs like that have been great, maybe, contributors to bringing us together, if not for anything than just for the common denominator of music... and that breaks down barriers.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In fact, that’s what Twain relies on when she’s performing songs that she’s written like this—appealing to the love of music over anything that could spark controversy. “I like to have a sense of humor about everything, especially things that can have a lot of tension,” she continued. “A song like ‘Man! I Feel Like a Woman!’ just smacks it dead for me. The audience issue is not something I worry about. I’m respectful to my audience, and I appreciate them for relating to my music regardless of their point of view on whatever it is, whether it’s politics or social issues. I’m not here to judge.”</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Twain believes “entertainment doesn’t have a gender”</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">More recently, Twain has said the song is about fully embracing her own femininity. She shied away from being overtly feminine when she was growing up to avoid unwanted male attention. But dancing at Toronto’s LGBTQ bars, while all dressed up with makeup on, was a liberating experience where she could “feel good about being female,” she told The Messenger. “That’s why it’s such a statement—not just ‘I Feel Like a Woman,’ but ‘Man! I Feel Like a Woman!’ and I love it, and I’m enjoying it, and I’m wearing it well.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">No matter her original intention, Twain has become an idol, especially in the drag queen community. The first time she came across a drag performer dressed as herself was at a Las Vegas imposter show.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It was incredible,” she said. “The country world... might be more conservative, but it’s funny, three of the artists that were in the show were myself, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/reba-mcentire data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Reba McEntire" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Reba McEntire</a>, and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/dolly-parton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Dolly Parton" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Dolly Parton</a>. I thought that was so wonderful… Any artist that is, on a visual level, very expressive would make a great imposter night subject.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Ultimately, Twain isn’t worried about her work and her legacy fitting traditional gender norms. “Entertainment doesn’t have a gender. The fashions that ended up stringing together my career—especially the epic, iconic looks—[go] both ways,” she told Macleans. “It can be drag queen-y as easily as it can be a sophisticated woman. We created a seamless, natural place for all of us.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In fact, she even proudly doles out advice for drag performers who want to mimic her style. As she told PrideSource, the essential ingredients are: “Something leopard print, and I would say a top hat. The boots, for sure!”<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGikrquZmLaiutJoqqGZnp6ubsDWmqCnZZ2Wu261jJ%2BcnqRdobassYyaZLCnnZa7brXNrKeiqpGptrC6jJ2pmp8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
