And portraying his adoptive mother “Teresa Kaepernick” was the seasoned actress Mary Louise-Parker, who critics believe did a pretty good job at it.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But while Mary’s on-screen feat is no mystery to many, what about her personal life? Did she have a boyfriend, or perhaps a husband? Learn all about it as this article proceeds.</span></p><h3><b>Does Mary Louise-Parker Have A Husband Or Boyfriend?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of 2021, Mary Louise-Parker kept her relationship under the wraps. It was unclear if she had a boyfriend or husband at the time.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Her last known relationship was with Charlie Mars, a musician she met in 2009. The two made quite a ruckus at the time, given their 10 years age difference. Some media outlets even labeled her as a “cougar.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>They broke up a few years later.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mary has also appeared in one of Charlie’s music videos titled “Listen to the Darkside” while they were together.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before Charlie, Mary was dated her </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Weeds</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> co-star Jeffrey Dean Morgan for a year before calling it quits in 2007.

Also, she later went on to adopt a daughter from Africa in 2007 named Caroline Aberash Parker.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>She shared that her daughter has an incredible laugh, “bubbly like soda pop.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>For the future man who’ll love her daughter, Mary wrote a letter in her book — “If she has given you children, remind yourself every day of the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth words in this sentence”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Also, she added that if her daughter is ever hurt “irreparably”, she will send out people to hurt him back. Mary even asked him to be a friend to her brother, and help each other out.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mary has also been romantically involved with Adam Duritz from </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>Counting Crows</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, celebrity trainer Pat Mannochia, and actor Timothy Hutton.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Since Mary loved penning her thoughts, in a letter titled “Dear Cerberus”, she merged three of her terrible exes into the mythical three-headed dog.
