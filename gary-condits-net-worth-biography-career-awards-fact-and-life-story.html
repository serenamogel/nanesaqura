Gary Condit was born in Salina, Oklahoma in April 1948. He graduated from Stanislaus State University, located in Turlock, California in 1972. He is a Democrat who served as a member of the U.S House of Representatives from California’s 15th district from September 1989 to January 1993. From January 1993 to January 2003 Condit was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from California’s 18th district. Condit gained attention for his extramarital affair with Chandra Levy after she disappeared in May 2001. He was not forthcoming with investigators about his relationship which led to speculation he was involved with her murder or disappearance. Another man was convicted but that was overturned because of lack of physical evidence and unreliable testimony. Condit moved to Arizona and operated two Baskin-Robbins ice cream shops which failed. He is now the president of the Phoenix Institute of Desert Agriculture.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BRp8Zur86nm6Kso2K7psCMsKarrJhir6q7xquYqaCpYrCivsSeqWaZp5a%2Fpb%2BMn5icrF2Wu6V5y6KdnmWjqbyzxY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
