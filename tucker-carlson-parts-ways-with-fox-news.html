Fox News Tonight will air in its stead while the media outlet decides on a new host.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Unsurprisingly, the departure comes with a significant, multi-faceted impact – perhaps best illustrated by Fox’s plummet at the stock market; if we live in a world where parting ways with one of media’s most vitriolic reactionaries results in significant stock suffering, it’s no small task to begin painting a rather dark picture.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Appears Fox stock is crashing after announcing Tucker Carlson’s show is over: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/4V1M3ww7r6</a></p>— Henry Rodgers (@henryrodgersdc) <a href=#>April 24, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=496 data-current-count=796 data-injectable=true>And while his departure from such a readily accessible and wide-ranging platform can easily be taken as a positive, especially considering the amount of hateful, unsubstantiated venom he managed to get away with, there’s not much stopping him from indulging in more independent practices, where his already free-ranging nonsense could become even more unchained. On top of that, it’s no question that his legions of followers will be more than happy to tune in to wherever he ends up.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Friendly reminder that Tucker Carlson already co-founded the very successful Daily Caller news organization</p><p>The sky is the limit with his future <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gZZPEMZr8i</a></p>— DC_Draino (@DC_Draino) <a href=#>April 24, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=187 data-current-count=487 data-injectable=true>Nevertheless, his departure is a net positive for journalism everywhere; the farther we can get the world’s most neurotic liars away from the world stage of information, the better.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING: Tucker Carlson is no longer working at Fox.</p><p>There should be no home to pathological liars who are the definition of fake news.

But miracles happen and it’s so glorious. Is it too much for me to wish Fox to also get rid of Laura Ingraham & Sean Hannity?</p>— Victor Shi (@Victorshi2020) <a href=#>April 24, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>And as the dust settles, we’ll be left with many a question; what might Carlson do next? Who will replace him on Fox News Tonight, and will they manage to find someone even more delusional to fill the void, or is Fox News truly attempting to clean up their act? Whatever the answers may be, there will no doubt be plenty to say, and we’re bracing ourselves for a fair portion of it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OumqSdomKwor7LrKanZaCWv7W%2FjLCYsqtdrLa1tIyfprFlnprEtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
