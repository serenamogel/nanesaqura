As <a href=#>People</a> tells us, the singer lost his 4-year-old daughter Skylar in 1995, when Neil himself was only 34. Young Skylar was diagnosed with Wilms' tumor (a form of kidney cancer) at a time when Neil was just coming back from a number of other personal and professional misfortunes. She had to go through extensive chemotherapy, radiation treatments and six operations, none of which were enough to save her life. Skylar Neil passed away on August 15, 1995, and the tragedy left Neil absolutely devastated. "This ordeal is something no parent should have to go through," he said of the nightmarish experience. "More than that, I wish no child ever had to go through it."</p><p>While Skylar was still fighting for her life, Neil wrote a track called "Skylar's Song" in her honor. The song played in the background as Neil and Skylar's mother sat in the hospital room and watched life slowly leave their daughter. Neil later included "Skylar's Song" on his solo album, Carved in Stone, and announced that he would donate all the proceeds of the song to charity. According to <a href=#>Ultimate Classic Rock</a>, the singer also set up the Skylar Neil Memorial Fund, which has since raised millions for children's cancer research.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9k3Fpa21fq7avr8RmpZ6hnKh6tb7AoKCcZaKarq15y6KdnmWjqbyzxY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
