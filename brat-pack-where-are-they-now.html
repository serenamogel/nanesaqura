Known for playing teen heroines who were fiercely independent and wise beyond their years, Ringwald was beloved for her relatability and authenticity. With Hughes, she starred in Sixteen Candles (1984), The Breakfast Club (1985) and Pretty in Pink (1986). After her Hughes collaborations, Ringwald played leading roles in the rom-coms The Pick-up Artist (1987) and For Keeps (1988), but also took on dramatic fare like Fresh Horses (1988).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the 1990s, Ringwald moved to Paris and starred in a number of French films before returning to the United States. She received positive reviews for her small-screen role in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/authors-writers/stephen-king data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stephen King's" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Stephen King's</a> The Stand in 1994 and also starred on Broadway in Cabaret as Sally Bowles.

Ringwald is also a jazz singer and released an album in 2013.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Anthony Michael Hall</h2><img alt="Anthony Michael Hall" title="Anthony Michael Hall" width=1950 height=1299 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brat-pack-anthony-michael-hall.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Anthony Michael Hall as Brian Johnson in ‘The Breakfast Club’; Hall in 2015; Photo: Universal Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection (left), Amanda Edwards/WireImage/Getty Images (right)</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the 1980s, Anthony Michael Hall was one of the most celebrated nerds of the era. With his wince-worthy dance moves, lip-blistering braces, muscle-less frame and cracking voice, Hall took on characters that embraced their nerdom with as much arrogance and joy as the jocks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Hall's claim to fame was wrapped up in the imagination and direction of Hughes, starting with National Lampoon's Vacation (1983), then Sixteen Candles (1984), and followed by The Breakfast Club (1985) and the sci-fi comedy Weird Science (1985).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Tired after years of playing the mega geek, Hall later explored the jock role in films like Johnny Be Good (1988) and Edward Scissorhands (1990). In the early 2000s, Hall also made a notable comeback when he nabbed the starring role in the television adaptation of King's The Dead Zone. More recently, Hall has appeared on a number of television shows such as Community, Murder in the First, Riverdale and The Goldbergs. Up next, Hall is set to join the Halloween franchise, playing Tommy Doyle in the 2020 sequel Halloween Kills.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Rob Lowe</h2><img alt="Rob Lowe" title="Rob Lowe" width=1950 height=1299 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brat-pack-rob-lowe.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Rob Lowe as Billy Hicks in 'St. Elmo's Fire'; Lowe in 2019; Photo: Columbia Pictures/Everett Collection (left), Noel Vasquez/Getty Images (right)</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With his square jaw, piercing blue eyes and dangling earring, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/rob-lowe data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rob Lowe" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rob Lowe</a> was the heartthrob of the Brat Pack. He shot to fame with films like The Outsiders (1983), Oxford Blues (1984), St. Elmo's Fire (1985) and About Last Night... (1986) — the latter two pushing him into sex symbol status. However, in 1988, Lowe's career had a setback when he was caught on video having sex with a 16-year-old girl. He eventually rebounded, coming back stronger than ever, starring in blockbusters like Tommy Boy (1995), Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997) and Contact (1997).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Lowe's also kept busy on television. In recent years, he's starred on TV shows such as The West Wing, Brothers & Sisters and Parks and Recreation, as well as the A&E reality show alongside his sons, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.aetv.com/shows/the-lowe-files data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Lowe Files" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">The Lowe Files</a>.

A dead ringer for his famous father, actor Martin Sheen, Estevez carved out a substantial career of his own, starting with The Outsiders (1983) and continuing with The Breakfast Club (1985) and St. Elmo's Fire (1985). The late 1980s and early '90s were good to Estevez who took on more adult roles with Stakeout (1987), Young Guns (1988) and The Mighty Ducks franchise.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">However, Estevez was just as interested in writing and directing as he was in acting. He's directed a number of television episodes on shows like Cold Case, CSI: NY and Numb3rs. In 2006, he wrote and directed the star-studded drama Bobby, for which he received a Hollywood Film Award.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Demi Moore</h2><img alt="Demi Moore" title="Demi Moore" width=1950 height=1299 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brat-pack-demi-moore.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Demi Moore as Debbie in 'About Last Night'; Moore in 2014; Photo: Everett Collection (left), Steve Granitz/WireImage/Getty Images (right)</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With her natural good looks, rebellious air and scratchy voice, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/demi-moore data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Demi Moore" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Demi Moore</a> became an It Girl of the 1980s, most notably in St. Elmo's Fire (1985) and the sexy rom-com About Last Night... (1986). But the '90s would be even better to Moore. She not only starred in the box office smash Ghost (1990), but she also added to her popularity with big-name films like A Few Good Men (1992), Indecent Proposal (1993) and the controversial Striptease (1996) — the last of which made her the highest-paid female star at the time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Most recently, Moore published a best-selling memoir, Inside Out, in September 2019.

Nelson actively worked throughout the 1980s and into the '90s, most notably in a number of Transformers films, New Jack City (1991), Airheads (1994) and television shows like Suddenly Susan. More recently, Nelson has done a lot of small-screen appearances on shows like The Outer Limits, CSI: NY, Psych, Two and a Half Men and Empire. He also does voiceover work for the latest Transformers animated series as Hot Rod/Rodimus Prime.</p><h2 data-node-id=41 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Andrew McCarthy</h2><img alt="Andrew McCarthy" title="Andrew McCarthy" width=1920 height=1279 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brat-pack-andrew-mccarthy.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">Andrew McCarthy as Blane in 'Pretty in Pink'; McCarthy in 2017; Photo: Paramount/Everett Collection (left), Johnny Louis/FilmMagic/Getty Images (right)</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With his sunny smile, boyish grin and talent for lip-locking (see: Pretty in Pink), Andrew McCarthy was one of the most swoon-worthy members of the Brat Pack. Besides Pretty in Pink (1986), McCarthy starred in St. Elmo's Fire (1985), Mannequin (1987), Less Than Zero (1987) and Weekend at Bernie's (1989) — often playing wide-eyed, angst-ridden characters that are burdened to handle some unforeseen emergency.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Outside of film, McCarthy also ventured onto the stage, performing on Broadway shows like Side Man, for which he won a Tony Award.

Thankfully, Sheedy wasn't relegated to oddball characters for the rest of her career. Throughout the 1980s, she starred in a variety of film roles like War Games (1983), St. Elmo's Fire (1985), Short Circuit (1986) and Maid to Order (1987).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=52 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sheedy worked consistently throughout the next decade, and in 1998 she drew attention and praise from audiences with her performance in the indie flick High Art, a story about two lesbians in the art world.
