The stylist was nominated for an Academy Award for her work on the House of Gucci.&nbsp;Lady Gaga’s hair and makeup were done by Aspiras for House of Gucci. Aside from that, he made history by being the second Asian-American to be nominated for an Oscar in the same category. For those who are unaware, the Academy created this award in response to protests about the lack of credit for the makeup artists in the 1980 film The Elephant Man. Following that, it went into effect in 1981.</p><h2>A profile of professional stylist and wigmaker Frederic Aspiras</h2><p>Frederic “Freddi” Aspiras was born on July 13, 1976, to immigrant parents. Aside from being a hairstylist, he also makes wigs. Since 2009, the San Francisco-based stylist has worked with Gaga.&nbsp;Aspiras has worked on a variety of projects and ad shots, as well as music videos and concerts, since the beginning as a hairstylist with Monster Ball in November 2009.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Frederic-Aspiras-2.jpg alt="Frederic Aspiras" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Aspiras has been Joico’s Celebrity Guest Artist since December 2018. As a result, the artist has started designing Gaga’s looks using the brand’s color, care, and style products.&nbsp;For the first time, Kim Kimble introduced Frederic. The stylist now works with Lady Gaga on a daily basis as part of Haus of Gaga.&nbsp;In a 2019 Billboard interview, Frederic said that he stores all of Gaga’s wigs in a warehouse or his New York studio. He went on to say Lady Gaga had a couple of them as well.</p><p>Aspiras won the Guild Award in 2016 for his outstanding work on American Horror Story: Hotel, as well as the 2019 Fashion Los Angeles “Hairstylist of the Year Award.” Frederic works with either natural hair and wigs or hair extensions, depending on the desired appearance, style, and color. Aspiras, who is of Vietnamese-Filipino origin, was also nominated for a BAFTA. He’s been collaborating with Gaga for the last 13 years. Aspiras oversaw the singer’s appearances on Variety’s Actors’ cover.&nbsp;During an interview with Variety, the artist discussed the significance of being acknowledged for his work, saying:</p><p>“I began with Lady Gaga 13 years ago, and fans from all over the globe who have written to me saying they’ve become hairdressers — that’s probably one of the most fulfilling things I’ve ever done.” It’s also about becoming a role model for my Asian American parents who are refugees.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Frederic-Aspiras-3.jpg alt="Frederic Aspiras" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Aspiras also said that designing three decades of designs for the House of Gucci was one of the most difficult jobs he has faced to date. While working with Gaga and fellow BAFTA candidate Sarah Tanno, his goal was to see Gaga as Patrizia Reggiani rather than merely imagine her on television. For House of Gucci, the artist developed 52 unique appearances using 10 wigs. Frederic Aspiras researched real-life pictures of Patrizia, Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida, and even the 1980s “Dynasty” Alexis Carrington persona. In order to duplicate diverse appearances, he also learnt about other affluent and stylish ladies of the day.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGifmqGiqMG6uMisq2aeopqxpr7InGSaq6Cev6K%2FjKaYnZ1dnba0ec%2BlmJydXZ67brvSnJirZZ6kuqq6wK2gqKajZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
