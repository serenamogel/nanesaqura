The 18-year-old model shared a snap of his new cut and color, posing in a black t-shirt, corduroy pants and white <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Within minutes the comments section exploded. Of course, there were a few favorable notes about the statement hairstyle. Even mom <a href=#><strong>Victoria Beckham</strong></a> gave her stamp of approval on the bright blonde style, which was done by hair colorist Josh Wood. She wrote, “Wow!!!! Love!!!” on the post.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>But David had quite the sassy bit of commentary about his son’s daring new ‘do. He started off sweet and wrote, “Nice hair,” going so far as to add a red heart emoji. Keep reading though, and the 46-year-old father straight up called out his kid.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/LOL-David-Beckham-Trolls-Son-Romeo-For-Copying-Bleach-Blonde-Hair-Inline.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s1>He added: “@romeobeckham I wonder where u got that idea from </span><span class=s2>😂</span>.” For context, the soccer star debuted a nearly identical style in 2007, just after joining the L.A. Galaxy.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>David’s objectively savage clap back raked up more than 1,300 likes and tons of comments. A few couldn’t get over the comedy of it all. One even said, “@davidbeckham wins the internet today. Try again tomorrow folks.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>Most however sided with the Bend It Like Beckham star, pointing out that he was the OG person to rock a bleach blonde buzz cut, before both <a href=#><strong>Eminem</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/LOL-David-Beckham-Trolls-Son-Romeo-For-Copying-Bleach-Blonde-Hair-Promo.jpg><p class=p3>“Beckham, I can tell he has surely copied this hair from you. Beckham, you had the best hairstyles ever and you still have [them],” one fan wrote. Another added: “Looks like his dad in the ‘90s/‘00s.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>Romeo hasn’t just switched up his hairstyle in recent days — he also added a new tattoo to his collection! On May 4, he took to Instagram to show off his ink, a simple smiley face just below his thumb. The design was done by celebrity-favorite tattoo artist <strong>Dr. Woo</strong>.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3>The ink seems to be a tribute tattoo in honor of his second anniversary with girlfriend <strong>Mia Regan</strong>. In the picture, Regan is pointing to the design.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3>Fan quickly popped into the comments section, noting how cute the couple is. One wrote, “My favorite couple,” while another noted that they “can’t wait for their wedding.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5mut7XDZpmem5udrq5506umpaSjYsCwuoyrpqadn2KzsL6MnKapsZmjtG60yKxkm62qr3qkwdNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
