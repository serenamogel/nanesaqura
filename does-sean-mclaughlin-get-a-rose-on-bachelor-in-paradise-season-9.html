When she quickly hit it off with the mature (and muscular) Blake Moynes, Sean found himself pushed aside, forcing him to explore his connections with some of the other women on the beach. During this process, he and former The Bachelorette lead, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rachel Recchia</a>, really hit it off, ultimately progressing to him offering her his first rose of the season — how sweet is that?</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>While it seemed to be smooth sailing between Sean and Rachel, things quickly took a turn when the 26-year-old tried to pursue a relationship with Jess (once again), ultimately resulting in rejection (once again). During his conversation with Jess, the controversial Brayden Bowers took it upon himself to flirt with Rachel. Unfortunately for Sean, Brayden’s definition of flirting meant throwing him under the bus.</p><p data-characters=320 data-current-count=320 data-injectable=false>Learning that Sean was never interested in her and only had eyes for Jess left the flight instructor rather unhappy (to say the least), causing a little bit of a scuffle between the pair down by the seashore. To follow, Sean and Brayden had a scuffle themselves, resulting in one giant mess of a love triangle — yikes!</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">With Rachel pursuing a connection with Brayden now</a> — which involved the duo locking lips with one another towards the end of episode four — Sean is left a single man, desperate to find love.</p><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>“I lost my job because I wanted to come here and find love, and if left tonight, not leaving with someone, I feel like everything I put on the line, like wouldn’t have been worth it, and it would suck,” Sean shared with Aaron Schwartzman, another man who is left single after <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sam Jeffries was medically evacuated</a> from the beach.</p><p data-characters=237 data-current-count=584 data-injectable=true>“Bachelor In Paradise Gods, can you please provide someone a little bit more open to dating someone 26 years old and looks like a Ken doll? Please? Thank you. Amen,” he dished in a confessional tone before a miracle occurred.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>To close out episode four, a shooting star flashes across the screen, and then we see a woman’s feet walking down the steps into Paradise. With twelve men and only seven women, will this hot new bombshell save one of the five men from elimination, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">or will this be another fake out like the Hannah Brown situation</a>?</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=true>While we don’t know who this new arrival is, keep scrolling to see whether or not she is Sean’s perfect match, sent down from the Bachelor In Paradise Gods (per his request).</p><h2 id=h-does-sean-mclaughlin-get-a-rose-on-bachelor-in-paradise-season-9 data-injectable=false>Does Sean McLaughlin get a rose on Bachelor in Paradise season 9?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/bachelor-in-paradise-sean-mcglaughlin.jpg><p data-characters=98 data-current-count=398 data-injectable=false>Unfortunately, the New York native did not receive a rose during his Bachelor In Paradise journey.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=628 data-injectable=true>While everything is mere speculation, an oh-so-telling <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> thread revealed that four men leave the beach during the second rose ceremony of the season: Will Urena, John Buresh, Aaron Schwartzman, and of course, Sean McLaughlin.</p><p data-characters=102 data-current-count=102 data-injectable=false>Just because this Ken doll did not find his Barbie in Paradise does not mean he is still a single man!</p><p data-characters=213 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>Given that Bachelor In Paradise season 9 was filmed this past summer, Sean has had plenty of time to find love since then.
