His career started in 1995.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Jason Blum is, as of mid- 2016? According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Jason’s net worth is as high as $20 million, an amount earned through his successful career as a producer. He also established and is a CEO of Blumhouse Productions, which has improved his wealth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=jason-blum-net-worth-20-million></span>Jason Blum Net Worth $20 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jason Blum was born into a Jewish family, a son of Irving Blum, an independent art dealer, and Shirley, an art professor. Blum studied at the Vassar College from where he graduated in 1991. His career really started in 1995, when he produced his first movie “Kicking and Screaming” with Josh Hamilton, Eric Stoltz, and Samuel Gould.</p><p>In the 90’s, Blum worked with Bob and Harvey Weinstein and later for Warner Bros as a producer, before he went on to be a producing director at Ethan Hawke’s Malaparte Theater Company. These two collaborated on “Hamlet” (2000) with Kyle MacLachlan, Bill Murray, and Julia Stiles. Blum later worked on “Hysterical Blindness” (2002) starring Uma Thurman, Juliette Lewis, and Gena Rowlands, “The Darwin Awards” (2006), with Joseph Fiennes, Winona Ryder, and David Arquette, and “Griffin & Phoenix” (2006), starring Amanda Peet, Dermot Mulroney, and Sarah Paulson. His net worth was well established.</p><p>In 2007, Blum produced the horror movie “Paranormal Activity” with Katie Featherston, Micah Sloat, and Mark Fredrichs. It cost only $15,000 but generated nearly $200 million at the box office, the most successful movie Blum has produced and which significantly increased his net worth. His company Blumhouse Productions was established in 2000 and specialised in making micro-budget films, and “Paranormal Activity” was one of them. In 2008, Blum was a co-executive producer of Oscar-winning drama “The Reader” starring Kate Winslet, Ralph Fiennes, and Bruno Ganz.</p><p>After the success of “Paranormal Activity” and “The Reader”, Blum became busier, and he produced more than 50 films during this decade. “Insidious” (2010) with Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne, and Ty Simpkins is one of them, generating more than $50 million with a budget of only $1.5 million. He continued with “Paranormal Activity 2” (2010), “Paranormal Activity 3” (2011), “Sinister” (2012) starring Ethan Hawke, “Lawless” (2012) with Tom Hardy, Shia LaBeouf, and Guy Pearce, and “Paranormal Activity 4” (2012).</p><p>The next two years were the busiest in Blum’s career, as he worked on “The Purge” (2013) starring Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, and Max Burkholder, “Oculus” (2013), “Insidious: Chapter 2” (2013), Oscar-winning drama “Whiplash” (2014) with Miles Teller, J.K. Simmons, and Melissa Benoist, “13 Sins” (2014), “Creep” (2014), and “The Normal Heart” (2014). Blum also filmed “The Purge: Anarchy” (2014), “Stretch” (2014) with Patrick Wilson, “The Lazarus Effect” (2015), “Insidious: Chapter 3” (2015), “The Gift” (2015) starring Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, and Joel Edgerton, and “The Visit” (2015), all of which increased his net worth by a large margin.</p><p>Most recently, Blum worked on “Sleight” (2016), “Hush” (2016), “Incarnate” (2016) starring Carice van Houten, Mark Steger, and Aaron Eckhart, “The Purge: Election Year” (2016), and “Viral” (2016). Blum is also in the middle of producing the following films: “Amityville: The Awakening” (2017), “Split” (2017) with James McAvoy, Haley Lu Richardson, and Anya Taylor-Joy, and “Insidious: Chapter 4” (2017).</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Jason Blum has been married to journalist Lauren A.E. Schuker since July 2012, and they are currently living in Los Angeles.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Jason Blum</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$20 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 20, 1969</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Los Angeles, California, U.S.</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Film producer, CEO of Blumhouse Productions</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Vassar College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Lauren A.

[The flop] Jem and the Holograms (2015) was a sure thing and in fact, it did the worst of all of them. It’s very tortuous, and it also should say that anything that any of us say today should be taken with a big grain of salt.[2015]</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>[his advice for aspiring filmmakers] Raise whatever you can and shoot whatever you can for whatever amount.[2015]</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>There’s a real correlation between not spending a lot of money and having fun.[2015]</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>If I was giving someone $30 million to make a horror movie, I would want every decision to be looked over by many, many people. But if you keep budgets down, you can let James Wan do what he does, fast, and let him focus on making the movie he wants to make. And if he wants to do something that seems a little out of the ordinary, if the budget is low it’s okay to let him do that.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>We have a lot of data for everything, so it’s not to say we don’t give lots of notes on the script, lots of thoughts about casting and lots of thoughts about the cuts of the movies. But the directors are free to take what they think makes the movie better and not use what they think doesn’t make it better. And surprise, surprise, when you give a director total control, they listen more, they solicit us more. The dialogue becomes healthier.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>There are a lot of parallels between doing a sequel and doing low budget movies, which is they give creative parameters. As a creative person myself, I work better with parameters as opposed to anything goes. Sequels force you to work creatively so that you don’t make a movie that people say, ‘That was so original, why was that a sequel? That should have just been its own movie. It had nothing to do with the first movie’. You don’t want them coming out saying, ‘Well, that movie felt exactly like the first movie. Why did I waste $14.50 on that?’. I think that’s fun. I really like the challenge of that.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>[on making horror films with an open ending] That I really discourage our filmmakers to do. On a micro-budget movie, I always tell them to make a great movie. If you make a great movie that succeeds, we’ll figure out a sequel.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Success is always a surprise. Maybe I lose a little less sleep, but still I lose sleep. There’s the movie itself obviously, there’s marketing, there’s the weather, current events. Everything can be right and then you have bad weather and you’re suddenly in trouble. There are so many factors that go into having a successful movie.. too many that you can’t control. I’m always thrilled and always surprised.</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head><span class=ez-toc-section id=producer></span>Producer <span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><table
