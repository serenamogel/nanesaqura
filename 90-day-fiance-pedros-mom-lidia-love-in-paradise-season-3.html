If Lidia came to the US, then she could certainly raise her harvesting profits and save a ton of money on TV shipping!</p><p>Pedro’s mom Lidia has talked a bit about her dating history on The Family Chantel. “Many years ago, I met my children’s father,” Lidia begins. “And then a year went by and one day he tells me that he has to tell me a secret.” A secret? Lidia definitely knows first-hand what a 90 Day Fiance relationship is like then!</p><p>“He tells me that he has two kids,” Lidia continues. “But then, later on, some more time goes by, and I already had my kids. And one day he tells me, ‘I have gone back to the mother of my children.’ And from that moment, he left. And well, I’ve never heard from him again.”</p><p>That experience would help explain why Lidia seems paranoid about every relationship her children enter into. “I had to take care of everything,” Lidia says. “The house, the kids, their education. And I don’t want Nicole to go through the same thing that I did.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube style=text-align:center;display:block></span></p><p>I am guessing Lidia’s bad relationship experience with the father of her children is going to come up again on 90 Day Fiance: Love In Paradise Season 3. Tune in to find out when the new season drops Monday, April 17 at 8/7c! (The press release seems to indicate that Love In Paradise Season 3 will be airing on TLC. I assume it will also be available on Discovery+.)</p><p><strong>UPDATE –</strong> <a href=#>@mac.and.chisme on Instagram</a> claims to have found Scott!
