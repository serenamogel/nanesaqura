And there’s so much of it—beyond the usual <a href=#>cheddar</a>, <a href=#>Swiss</a>, or even <a href=#>American</a>. There’s gouda, <a href=#>brie</a>, camembert, and, today’s topic, havarti. Havarti may be a less celebrated cheese, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less tasty. But what is havarti cheese, exactly? What does havarti taste like? How does one best use it? Let’s get the havarti party started and find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-havarti-cheese><strong>What is havarti cheese?</strong></h2><p>Havarti is a semi-soft Danish cheese made from cow’s milk that is typically aged for three months. Like Swiss cheese, it often has <a href=#>holes, or “eyes,” in it</a>, though its taste and texture vary from Swiss cheese.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-havarti-cheese-from><strong>Where is havarti cheese from?</strong></h2><p>Havarti is a Danish cheese, which in this instance does not mean that it’s a cheese that would be good in a danish (although it probably would be). It means that Havarti is originally from Denmark.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-does-havarti-cheese-taste-like><strong>What does havarti cheese taste like?</strong></h2><p>Looking through descriptions of havarti, the words “buttery,” “smooth,” and “slightly sweet” come up most often. Keep in mind, there are milder and sharper grades of havarti, just like with other cheeses.</p><p>Because of its relatively unassuming flavor profile, cheesemakers often infuse havarti with other flavors, commonly horseradish and dill (one of the <a href=#>best Aldi cheeses</a> is a dill-infused havarti, if you’re looking to give it a try).&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-havarti-cheese-similar-to><strong>What is havarti cheese similar to?</strong></h2><p>Because of the holes in havarti, it looks the most similar to swiss cheese. However, in terms of texture and flavor, it’s much closer to something like gouda, muenster, or fontina.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-does-havarti-cheese-melt><strong>Does havarti cheese melt?</strong></h2><p>Yes, havarti cheese is on the meltier side of the spectrum, making it a good choice for grilled cheeses, burgers, and any other dish that could use some gooey cheesy goodness.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-havarti-cheese-good-for><strong>What is havarti cheese good for?</strong></h2><p>As you will see if you click on <a href=# rel=noopener>this list from Insanely Good Recipes</a>, there is truly no end to the applications of havarti cheese. Because it is so creamy and relatively benign, you can use it anywhere you’d use cheddar, Swiss, or whatever your favorite melting cheese might be. We’re talking the base of a cheese dip, a little flavor pop in a grilled cheese and bacon sandwich, a twist on classic <a href=#>mac and cheese</a>, and on and on.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-to-make-havarti-cheese><strong>How to make havarti cheese?</strong></h2><p>Though it’s a less common cheese than some of the old standbys, it shares the same process as most cheeses. Essentially, <a href=# rel=noopener>rennet</a> is introduced to milk to make it curdle. The resulting curds are pushed into a mold and drained, and then the cheese is aged. Havarti is usually aged for three months.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-is-havarti-a-hard-cheese><strong>Is havarti a hard cheese?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Havarti is classified as a semi-soft cheese. It’s less pliable and harder than something like brie or camembert, but much softer and more pliable than a hard cheese such as parmesan, cheddar, or <a href=#>gruyère</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFutdJmn5qukafBqnnCoZyeq5Vk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 InkBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
