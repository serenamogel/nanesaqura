The character himself&nbsp;isn’t all that interesting or well-known, but the actor&nbsp;that will play him is. According to THR,&nbsp;The Shawshank Redemption, Starship Troopers,&nbsp;and beloved voice actor Clancy Brown has joined the series in a “pivotal recurring role.”</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Brown will play General Wade Eiling a.k.a. The General, the head of a black ops army team pursuing Plastique (<a title="Kelly Frye To Play Plastique On The Flash" href=#>Kelly Frye</a>),&nbsp;in hopes of turning her into a human weapon. The General is described as “a tall and imposing man with a face carved from years of duty.” He’s also a fanatic intent on protecting American interests around the world, and will have “ties to a central&nbsp;Flash&nbsp;character.”</p><p data-characters=533 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>There are multiple versions of The General in the comics, one of the most recent&nbsp;being a normal General who injects himself with a “Captain Nazi” super-soldier serum and becomes a large, hulking and super-strong humanoid. General Eiling himself is a pretty dangerous guy, who at one point fired&nbsp;a nuclear missile to kill Superman, completely content with the human casualties it would cause. In other words, he’s going to be a&nbsp;massive&nbsp;threat to the Flash and his team, whether he’s a hulking brute or not.</p><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>This won’t be Brown’s first foray into comic book adaptations. He voiced the villain Parallax in Warner Brothers’ ill-fated Green Lantern,&nbsp;and&nbsp;voiced Lex Luthor several times over the years in animated shows like&nbsp;Justice League, The Batman,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Superman.&nbsp;Additionally, he’s lent his&nbsp;talents to Marvel cartoons like&nbsp;Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.&nbsp;(in which he plays Red Hulk, a character very similar to The General),&nbsp;The Spectacular Spider-Man,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Avengers: Earth’s Mightiest Heroes.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>The General will make his first appearance in&nbsp;The Flash‘s fifth episode, which means we luckily won’t have to wait long before we get to see Brown in action. Plus, his character’s ties to the Suicide Squad in the comics means he may stick around for a bit, crossover with&nbsp;Arrow&nbsp;at some point, and even show up in that&nbsp;Suicide Squad&nbsp;spin-off that’s been teased.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=false>Tell us, what do you think of Clancy Brown as The General?
